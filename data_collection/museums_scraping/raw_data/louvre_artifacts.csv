This graceful statue of a goddess has intrigued and fascinated since its discovery on the island of Melos in 1820. Is it Aphrodite, who was often portrayed half-naked, or the sea goddess Amphitrite, who was venerated on Melos? The statue reflects sculptural research during the late Hellenistic Period: classical in essence, with innovatory features such as the spiral composition, the positioning in space, and the fall of the drapery over the hips.

	The discovery of a mutilated masterpiece
The Venus de Milo was discovered in 1820 on the island of Melos (Milos in modern Greek) in the south-western Cyclades. The Marquis de Rivière presented it to Louis XVIII, who donated it to the Louvre the following year. The statue won instant and lasting fame. Essentially two blocks of marble, it is comprised of several parts which were sculpted separately (bust, legs, left arm and foot) then fixed with vertical pegs, a technique which was fairly common in the Greek world (especially in the Cyclades, where this work was produced around 100 BC). The goddess originally wore metal jewelry — bracelet, earrings, and headband — of which only the fixation holes remain. The marble may have been embellished with (now faded) polychromy. The arms were never found.

	A mysterious goddess with neither name nor attributes
The goddess is shrouded in mystery, her attitude a persistent enigma. The missing pieces of marble and absence of attributes made the restoration and identification of the statue difficult. A whole range of positions have been suggested: leaning against a pillar, resting her elbow on Ares' shoulder, or holding a variety of attributes. According to whether she held a bow or an amphora, she was Artemis or a Danaid. She is popularly thought to represent Aphrodite, because of her half-nakedness and her sensual, feminine curves. She may have held an apple — an allusion to the Judgement of Paris — a crown, a mirror, or a shield in which she admired her reflection. However she might also be the sea goddess Amphitrite, who was venerated on the island of Melos.

	A Hellenistic creation: a blend of classical tradition and innovation
The statue has sometimes been thought to be a replica, freely inspired by an original from the late 4th century BC, because of its resemblance to the Aphrodite of Capua (Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples) — a similar style Roman work, copy of a Greek original. The Venus de Milo certainly revives the classical tradition, but would appear to be a classicizing re-creation dating from the late 2nd century BC. The goddess's air of aloofness, the harmony of her face and her impassivity are stamped with the aesthetics of the 5th century BC; the hairstyle and delicate modeling of the flesh evoke the works of 4th-century sculptor Praxiteles. However, the sculpture reflects innovations that appeared during the Hellenistic period, between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC. The spiral composition, the positioning of the figure in three-dimensional space, and the small-breasted, elongated body are characteristic of this period. The goddess is arrested in time, holding her legs together as the drapery slides over her hips. Her nudity contrasts with the effects of light and shade of the finely-detailed drapery.

Discovered in 1698 in Golconda, India, this stone immediately attracted the interest of Thomas Pitt, the English governor of Madras. Cut in England, it was then purchased for the French Crown at the behest of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans in 1717. The Regent surpassed in beauty and weight all the diamonds known in the western world until that time. Even today, its flawless brilliance and perfect cut ensure that it is still considered the finest diamond in the world.

	How the ""Regent"" was acquired and then cut in England

	Following its discovery in India in 1698, the stone was acquired by Thomas Pitt, Governor of Fort St George in Madras, for a very high price. The diamond weighed 426 carats before it was shipped to England in 1702 to be cut. This operation took two years, from 1704 to 1706, and produced several secondary stones, which were sold to Tsar Peter the Great. Performed by a jeweler by the name of Harris, this cut is the culmination of a technique possibly invented in Venice in the early seventeenth century: the brilliant cut. In this process, the angles, formed by the facets, are of a perfect cut, reflecting the light with matchless intensity and brilliance.

	The acquisition of the diamond by Philippe d'Orléans

	Taking advantage of the economic prosperity that developed in France under the influence of John Law, Philippe d'Orléans, regent from 1715 to 1723, persuaded the Regency Council to purchase the diamond on 6 June 1717. At the time, The Regent outshone all known diamonds in the western world, and by 1719 it had already tripled in value. Today, it is still considered the finest diamond in the world; its color is ""of the first water"", that is perfectly white and practically flawless. After the Regency, the gem remained one of the most precious of the Crown's treasures and adorned all the crowned heads of France.

	The ""Regent"" and the royal succession

The Regent was worn for the first time by Louis XV at the reception of a Turkish embassy in 1721. It was then mounted temporarily on the king's crown for his coronation ceremony on 25 October 1722. Shortly after his marriage to Maria Leczinska on 5 September 1725, Louis XV began wearing the diamond on his hat, a habit he continued throughout his reign. For the coronation of Louis XVI, on 11 June 1775, a new crown was made similar to that of Louis XV, featuring The Regent on the front. Like his grandfather, Louis XVI sported the gem on his hat. Stolen in 1792, then found again the following year hidden in some roof timbers, the diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat, before being permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801. The First Consul used it to embellish his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, the work of Nitot. Following changes in the ruling regime, the diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III, and finally on the Grecian diadem of Empress Eugénie.

This decorative frieze of polychrome glazed brick shows an army, the men carrying spears, bows and quivers. Are they the royal guards of Darius I (522–486 BC), whom Herodotus called “the Immortals,” or might they represent an idealized image of the Persian people? The frieze is probably inspired by the brick friezes of Babylon, although the technique is different. That may be a legacy from the Middle Elamite Period, which saw the appearance of decoration in glazed siliceous brick.
Archers on parade
The Frieze of Archers had two symmetrical lines of soldiers, parading at a slow march. Each archer’s hands are joined together on the shaft of his spear, and hanging from his shoulders is a bow, its ends in the form of duck’s heads, and a quiver. The butt of the spear, held vertical, rests on the front foot, shod like the other in a laced ankle-boot. The archers wear the long Persian robe, braided and pleated over the legs, the outline of whose ample sleeve describes a curve towards the belted waist. They are bearded, and their thick curly hair is massed at the nape of the neck, held back by a diadem of beaten metal. Each brick is molded from a quart-based body; its outer face is rectangular, but the brick tapers towards the back, a little like a quoin, so as to leave room for mortar when the decorated faces are butted up against each other. The frieze combines low relief and color, with glazes of green, brown, white and yellow separated by fine cloisons of siliceous body.
An inheritance from the Elamite period?
This decorative frieze was certainly inspired by the Processional Way in Babylon, constructed by Nebuchadnezar II (604–562 BC), but the technique is different. The Babylonians used clay for their bricks, rather than the siliceous material employed here. The artists who worked for Darius may have revived a technique developed at Susa by the Elamites in the Late Elamite Period at the end of the second millennium. Polychrome brick decoration in Iran would have a great future in the architecture of the Islamic age.
The Immortals?
Although the British archaeologist W. K. Loftus, the first to excavate at Susa, had identified the main lines of the apadana, he had recognized only isolated motifs, palmettes and rosettes, from its glazed brick decoration. When Marcel Dieulafoy continued his predecessor’s work he discovered enough bricks to make possible the fairly convincing reconstruction displayed at the Louvre: two panels representing a procession of archers, framed by decorative motifs and surmounted by crenellations inspired by the facades of the rock-tombs of Persepolis and Naqsh-e Rustam. The rare inscribed bricks, on which one can still make out the name of Darius, were positioned in the middle. The archers were then assembled as separate panels. While the Lion Frieze was found on the ground at its original position in the East Court of the palace, the exact location of the Frieze of Archers is unknown, countless bricks and fragments having been found more or less all over the place when the apadana was excavated. Their number does suggest a hypothesis: the archers may have been positioned at regular intervals in several registers, over the height of the wall, as at Babylon. They would then have occupied a great part of the exterior walls of the palace, extending over hundreds of metres. How should such a colossal ensemble be understood? Were these men the ‘Immortals,’ the élite regiment of 10,000 men? Or might they rather represent an ideal image, repeated to infinity, of the ‘Persian people,’ a constituent element of the unified empire brought together under the rule of the king, to whom it might have been necessary to accord a special place in the old Elamite capital of Susa?

3,Masterpieces,"Horse Restrained by a Groom, called ""Horse of Marly""",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/horses-restrained-grooms-known-marly-horses?selection=44909,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-cheval-retenu-par-palefrenier.jpg?1527825908,"
These two large marble sculptures representing horses restrained by grooms were commissioned in 1739 for the horse pond in the gardens of the Château de Marly. In 1743, the king chose the models exhibited in the Louvre courtyard; the marble sculptures were installed at Marly in 1745. In 1749, they were moved to Paris on the initiative of the painter David, and placed on high pedestals at the bottom of the Champs-Elysées.
A work of diverse inspiration, commissioned to replace another
The statues of Fame and Mercury, commissioned by Louis XIV from Antoine Coysevox for the horse pond at Marly, were taken to the Tuileries in 1719. Louis XV discovered the Château de Marly in 1739 and, to fill the gap left by the removal of the sculptures, commissioned two groups from Guillaume I Coustou (Coysevox's nephew). Coustou's achievement rivaled that of his deceased uncle with its technical prowess: two colossal works, sculpted from a monolithic block of Carrara marble in the record time of two years (1743-45). Many details, such as the bridle (now broken), the tousled mane, the light and floating tail, and the bearskin on the horse's back, required delicate carving.The artist was probably inspired by the antique statues of the Dioscuri with their rearing horses in front of the Quirinal Palace in Rome, and prestigious examples of such horses from French sculpture of the 18th century, such as the Horses of the Sun by the Marsy brothers (a model of which is in the Louvre). He was no doubt sensitive to the recent masterpiece by Robert Le Lorrain (c. 1737), a high-relief for the stable at the Hôtel de Rohan. Above all, he drew his inspiration from nature, studying the movements of men and horses from live models.
Emulation and innovation
The novelty of this work lies in the absence of any mythological or allegorical reference. It represents primitive nature, a struggle between two wild forces: an untamed horse and a naked man, athletic muscles straining. Coysevox's military trophies have been replaced here by reeds and rocks on an uneven ground. The powerful, thick-necked horse shows every sign of panic and anger: rearing up, tossing its head and whinnying, with dilated eyes and nostrils, and a tousled mane. The almost invincible force of nature seems about to break free again. Wherever the spectator stands, the impression of movement, strength, and violent struggle is perceptible. A moment in time has been captured, heralding something of the Romantic works of Géricault. Indeed, Victor Hugo admired ""those neighing marbles [...] prancing in a cloud of gold"". Coustou claimed to have sculpted (American) Indian slaves, which explains the quiver and feathered headdress that have fallen to the ground in the struggle. The reference is approximate (one groom appears to be from the West, the other African), but the sculpture prefigures Rousseau's idea of the ""noble savage"" - an idea already propagated by the accounts of travelers and missionaries.
Protective transfers
From the outset, Coustou's horses were considered to be masterpieces of French sculpture and were spared the fate of the Château de Marly (destroyed during the Revolution). In 1795, on the orders of the painter David, they were taken to the Place de la Révolution (now the Place de la Concorde) at the bottom of the Champs-Elysées, to join the sculptures of Coysevox. The Marly Horses were moved to the Louvre in 1984 to be conserved, and were replaced by copies on the Place de la Concorde and at Marly.

4,Masterpieces,"July 28. Liberty Leading the People (July 28, 1830)",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/july-28-liberty-leading-people?selection=44909,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-le-28-juillet-la-liberte-guidant-le-peuple-28-juillet-1830.jpg?1527831264,"
The Paris uprising of July 27, 28, and 29, 1830, known as the Trois Glorieuses (""Three Glorious Days""), was initiated by the liberal republicans for violation of the Constitution by the Second Restoration government. Charles X, the last Bourbon king of France, was overthrown and replaced by Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. Delacroix, who witnessed the uprising, perceived it as a modern subject for a painting; the resulting work reflects the same romantic fervor he had applied to Massacre at Chios, a painting inspired by the Greek war of independence.
A patriotic act
Delacroix's imagination was fired by all manner of things—the natural world, a Gothic ribbed vault, a feline, a journey, a human passion... or an event that changed the course of history and reversed artistic trends. He translated his deeply felt emotions into painting, constantly renewing his style. His emotional temperament largely explains the force of his portrayal of the recent explosion of rage on the streets of Paris. 
No doubt he felt a personal involvement too, through his friendship with protagonists of the conflict such as Adolphe Thiers, who wavered between maintenance of the constitutional Monarchy and restoration of the Republic. Delacroix depended on commissions from institutions and members of the royal family, and his personal ambiguity probably confined him to the role of simple bystander (noted by Alexandre Dumas), but as a citizen-artist he helped protect the Louvre's collections from the rioters and, nostalgic for the Napoleonic Empire, was moved to see the tricolor hoisted to the top of Notre-Dame by the insurgents. 
The time had come to fulfill his own patriotic duty. He wrote to his nephew Charles Verninac: ""Three days amid gunfire and bullets, as there was fighting all around. A simple stroller like myself ran the same risk of stopping a bullet as the impromptu heroes who advanced on the enemy with pieces of iron fixed to broom handles."" 
Delacroix began his allegorical interpretation of the Parisian epic in September 1830. His painting was completed between October and December, and exhibited at the Salon in May 1831. 
As was his habit, he developed his plan for the painting using preliminary sketches for every element and at every stage. He also drew from the repertory of motifs that he had compiled on a daily basis from the beginning of his career. He thus completed the work in three months, focusing on the dramatic and visual impact of the scene: the crowd breaking through the barricades to make its final assault on the enemy camp. 
The peak of fervor occasioned by victory is represented in a pyramidal composition; the base, strewn with corpses, resembles a pedestal supporting the image of the victors. Delacroix had used a similarly rigorous composition for his painting entitled Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi, and a comparable structure is apparent in Géricault's Raft of the Medusa. Here, it serves to contain and balance the painter's vigorous brushwork, and the impetuous rhythm of the scene.
A Parisian revolution
The allegory of Liberty is personified by a young woman of the people wearing the Phrygian cap, her curls escaping onto her neck. Vibrant, fiery, rebellious, and victorious, she evokes the Revolution of 1789, the sans-culotte, and popular sovereignty. In her raised right hand is the red, white, and blue flag, a symbol of struggle that unfurls toward the light like a flame. 
Liberty wears a yellow dress reminiscent of classical drapery, held in at the waist by a belt whose ends float at her side. It has slipped below her breasts, revealing the underarm hair considered vulgar by classical artists who decreed that a goddess's skin should be smooth. The erotic realism of her nudity recalls the ancient winged victories. Her Greek profile, straight nose, generous mouth, delicate chin, and smoldering gaze are reminiscent of the woman who posed for the Women of Algiers in their Apartment. She stands noble and resolute, her body illuminated on the right, cutting a distinct figure among the men as she turns her head to spur them on to final victory. Her dark left side stands out against a plume of smoke. Her weight is on her bare left foot, visible below her dress. She may be an allegory, but this is a real battle, and she is caught up in the heat of the moment. The infantry gun with bayonet (1816 model) in her left hand gives her a contemporary look and a certain credibility. 
Two Parisian urchins have spontaneously joined the fight: the one on the left clings to the cobblestones, wide-eyed under his light infantry cap; the more famous figure to the right of Liberty is Gavroche, a symbol of youthful revolt against injustice and sacrifice for a noble cause. He sports the black velvet beret (or faluche) worn by students, as a symbol of rebellion, and carries an overlarge cartridge pouch slung across his shoulder. He advances right foot forward, brandishing cavalry pistols with one arm raised, a war cry on his lips as he exhorts the insurgents to fight. 
The fighter whose beret bears a white royalist cockade and red liberal ribbon and who carries an infantry saber (1816 model) or briquet, is recognizably a factory worker with his apron and sailor trousers. The scarf holding his pistol in place on his belly evokes the Cholet handkerchief—a rallying sign for Royalist leader Charette and the Vendeans.
The kneeling figure with the top hat of a bourgeois or fashionable urbanite may be Delacroix himself, or one of his friends. He wears loose-fitting trousers and an artisan's red flannel belt, and carries a double-barreled hunting gun. The wounded man raising himself up at the sight of Liberty wears a knotted yellowish scarf, echoing the color of the heroine's dress; his peasant's smock and red flannel belt suggest the temporary workers of Paris. The blue jacket, red belt, and white shirt echo the colors of the flag.
A modern subject
""I have undertaken a modern subject, a barricade, and although I may not have fought for my country, at least I shall have painted for her. It has restored my good spirits"" (letter of October 28 to his brother). The soldiers lying on the ground take up the foreground at the base of the pyramidal structure. In addition to the figure of Liberty, the corpse without trousers on the left, with arms outstretched and tunic turned up, is another mythical reference, derived from a classical nude model known as Hector—a personification of the Homeric hero. The Swiss guard lying on his back, to the right of the scene, has contemporary campaign uniform: a gray-blue greatcoat with a red decoration on the collar, white gaiters, low shoes, and a shako. A cuirassier with a white epaulette, lying face down next to him, is visible down to the waist. 
To the left at the back of the triangle are students (including a student of the Ecole Polytechnique with his Bonapartist cocked hat) and a detachment of grenadiers in gray greatcoats and campaign uniform. 
Although the right background of the painting contains elements of an urban landscape, it seems empty and distant in comparison with the pitched battle that fills the left side of the scene. The towers of Notre Dame represent liberty and Romanticism—as they did for Victor Hugo—and situate the action in Paris. Their position on the left bank of the Seine is inexact, and the houses between the Cathedral and the river are pure products of the painter's imagination. A sunset glow, mingled with the canon smoke, illuminates the baroque postures of the bodies and shines bright in the right background, creating an aura around Liberty, the young boy, and the tricolor flag. 
As we have already seen, the composition is given unity by the painter's particularly skilful use of color; the blue, white, and red elements have counterpoints; the white of the parallel straps across the fighters’ shoulders echoes that of the gaiters and of the shirt on the corpse to the left, while the gray tonality enhances the red of the flag. 
Delacroix was admired by Charles X, who purchased The Massacre at Chios and the Death of Charles the Bold. The artist's friends included the Duchesse de Berry and the Orléans family. He liked to attract attention in the circles of power and make his mark on public opinion, but was considered at that time as leader of the Romantic movement and was impassioned by liberty. His emotion during the Three Glorious Days was sincere, and was expressed to the glory of the ""noble, beautiful, and great"" citizens of his country. 
Delacroix's historical and political painting—a blend of document and symbol, actuality and fiction, reality and allegory—bears witness to the death throes of the Ancien Régime.This realistic and innovative work, a symbol of Liberty and the pictorial revolution, was rejected by the critics, who were used to more classical representations of reality. Having hailed the accession of Louis-Philippe, the work was hidden from public view during the king's reign, and only entered the Musée du Luxembourg in 1863 and the Louvre in 1874. It is now perceived as a universal work—a representation of romantic and revolutionary fervor, heir to the historical painting of the 18th century and forerunner of Picasso's Guernica in the 20th.

5,Masterpieces,"Code de Hammurabi, roi de Babylone",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/law-code-hammurabi-king-babylon?selection=44909,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-code-hammurabi-roi-babylone_1.jpg?1527822074,"

The Law Code of Hammurabi is the emblem of the Mesopotamian civilization. This high basalt stele erected by the king of Babylon in the 18th century BC is a work of art, history and literature, and the most complete legal compendium of Antiquity, dating back to earlier than the Biblical laws. Carried there by a prince from the neighboring country of Elam in Iran in the 12th century BC, the monument was exhibited on the Susa acropolis among other prestigious Mesopotamian masterpieces.

	A legal tradition

	This basalt stele was erected by King Hammurabi of Babylon (1792–1750 BC) probably at Sippar, city of the sun god Shamash, god of justice. Other monuments of this type belonging to a similar tradition were placed in the towns of his kingdom. Two Sumerian legal documents drawn up by Ur-Namma, king of Ur (c. 2100 BC) and Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c.1930 BC), precede the Law Code of Hammurabi. The Hammurabi Code—the most important legal compendium of the ancient Near East, drafted earlier than the Biblical laws—found its sources in these essays. The text, which occupies most of the stele, constitutes the raison d'être of the monument. The principal scene depicted shows the king receiving his investiture from Shamash. Remarkable for its legal content, this work is also an exceptional source of information about the society, religion, economy, and history of this period.

	The content of the Code

	The text is written in cuneiform script and the Akkadian language. It is divided into three parts:
	- a historical prologue relating the investiture of King Hammurabi in his role as ""protector of the weak and oppressed,"" and the formation of his empire and achievements;
	- a lyrical epilogue summing up his legal work and preparing its perpetuation in the future;
	- these two literary passages frame a text describing almost three hundred laws and legal decisions governing daily life in the kingdom of Babylon. The legal part of the text uses everyday language and is here simplified, for the king wanted it to be understood by all. However, the legal decisions are all constructed in the same manner: a phrase in the conditional sets out a problem of law or social order; it is followed by a response in the future tense, in the form of the sanction for the guilty party or the settlement of a situation: ""Should an individual do such and such a thing, such and such a thing will happen to him or her.""
	Grouped together in chapters, the issues addressed cover criminal and civil laws. The principal subjects are family law, slavery, and professional, commercial, agricultural and administrative law. Economic measures set prices and salaries. The longest chapter concerns the family, which formed the basis of Babylonian society. It deals with engagement, marriage and divorce, adultery and incest, children, adoption and inheritance, and the duties of children's nurses. Every aspect of each case is addressed, enabling the greatest number of observations to be made.

	The significance of the monument

	The Law Code of Hammurabi is valuable first and foremost as a model, being a treatise on the exercise of judiciary power in the context of Mesopotamian science, in which the particular never governs the general.
	The observation of several similar cases does not establish a general and universal principle, or law. It is not a code of laws in the sense that we understand it today, but rather a compendium of legal precedents. Contradictions and illogicalities (two similar cases causing different results) can be found in the Code, because it deals with particular judgements, from which the most personal elements (the names of the protagonists, for example) have been removed. Because justice was a royal prerogative in Mesopotamia, Hammurabi here sets out a selection of the wisest legal decisions that he had to take or ratify.
	This stele was, however, more than an educational tool. It was a code of the rules and prescriptions established by a sovereign authority, and therefore a code of laws. Not only does it contain a list of judicial rulings, but also a catalogue of the towns and territories annexed to the kingdom of Babylon. The stele of the Babylonian king Hammurabi constitutes a summary of one of the most prestigious reigns of ancient Mesopotamia. Executed in the last years of the sovereign's life, it was a political testament aimed at future princes, for whom it offered a model of wisdom and equity. The Code also served as a literary model for the schools of scribes, who were to copy it for over one thousand years.

Given to Cardinal Barberini by Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc in the early seventeenth century, the Barberini Ivory must already have been in Provence by the seventh century: on the back is a list of Barbarian kings and officials of the region. This is the only near-complete leaf of an imperial diptych to have come down to us. Its central section portrays the Emperor Anastasius (491-518) or, more likely, Justinian (527-565) in triumph, and its upper part, the glorification of Christ.   
The Barberini Ivory: a near-complete imperial diptych
This is the only near-complete leaf of an imperial diptych to have come down to us. The leaves were composed of five separate elements. Here only the right-hand plaque is missing: like the others it was held in place around the central plaque by a tongue and groove system that made possible the considerable width of the leaf as a whole.The back of the leaf is inscribed with the names of officials of the seventh-century kingdom of Austrasia. Kept in Provence at this time, it was rediscovered in the home of the scholar of Aix-en-Provence, Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc, in the seventeenth century. The diptych owes its name to Cardinal Barberini, to whom Peiresc gave it as a gift. 
View of a triumph
The center of the diptych is occupied by a carving in high relief of the triumph of a mounted emperor. To his right, but now lost, an allegory of Victory, set on a globe engraved with a cross, held out a crown to him. A spear in the horseman's right hand is planted in the ground to hold back a bearded figure - a Persian or Scythian, it would seem, judging by the clothing and cap. Sitting beneath the horse's hoofs, a woman symbolizing the Earth holds the emperor's right foot in a gesture of submission. In the upper section, a bust of Christ administering a blessing is flanked by Winged Victories. On the left, a soldier is preparing to give the horseman a statuette of Victory bearing a laurel wreath. At the bottom, the vanquished have come to pay tribute to their conqueror. The overall composition is dominated by the triumphal scene and the omnipotence of the Byzantine emperor.
Justinian, Constantine, or Anastasius?
Despite a marked resemblance to portraits of Constantine (324-340), the emperor shown here would seem to be Justinian (527-565), given the period indicated by the style of the piece. Some commentators have opted for Anastasius (491-518), second husband of the empress Ariadne (d. 515). The two ivory figures of empresses - both identified as Ariadne - in the Vienna Museum and the Bargello (National Museum of Sculpture) in Florence have undeniable affinities with the central section of the Barberini Ivory, especially in that they are virtually sculpted in the round. However, the stylistic differences do not allow for any definite correlation, and the leaf in the Louvre seems a little later. Such factors as analogies with the reliefs on the episcopal throne in Ravenna, and the association of Christ administering a blessing with a Byzantine emperor - attested on the Consul Justin diptych, with its medallions of Justinian, Christ, and the empress Theodora, side by side - mean the Barberini Ivory can be attributed to the Constantinople workshops of the second quarter of the sixth century. This would thus seem to be a triumphal portrait of Justinian who, in 532, signed a ""peace treaty"" with the Persians.

This portrait was commissioned as a gift for Philip V of Spain. However, it was such a success at court that it was never sent to Spain. Every detail of the work is aimed at producing the quintessential image of absolute power: the nobility of the antique setting, the crimson curtain, and the solemnity of the Sun King wearing his coronation robes embroidered with the royal fleur de lys. 
Louis XIV
Louis XIV (1638-1715), the son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, was one of France's most important monarchs. He ruled from 1643 to 1715 and was known as the Sun King. His childhood was marked by the political troubles of the Fronde, so throughout his reign he sought to maintain the unity of the kingdom at all cost, crushing any moves the aristocracy made to obtain extra power. In 1660 he married Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1661, after the death of Cardinal Mazarin, finally free of his influence, Louis XIV wielded absolute power, but was shrewd enough to surround himself with devoted and talented ministers such as Colbert, Louvois, and Vauban. The royal purse, the army, industry, and administration were all reformed and trade blossomed. Louis XIV also greatly encouraged the arts. The château of Versailles is the finest achievement of his reign.
The king's coronation robes
At the time of the portrait, Louis XIV was 63 years old. He is shown wearing his coronation robes, the royal sword at his side, and holding the royal scepter. The crown is on a stool beside him. The painting of the robes is particularly detailed and refined, if somewhat overdone, reminding the viewer of the king's greatness. Other artists from Rigaud's studio must have worked on some parts of the painting, but the king's face - painted on paper mounted on the finished canvas - was the work of Rigaud himself, who produced a lifelike yet noble portrait.
A commission for the king of Spain
Louis XIV in fact commissioned the portrait as a gift for his grandson Philip V of Spain. The painting was shown at the 1704 Salon and then became part of the Louis XIV Collection. It remained in the royal collections until after the Revolution, when in 1793 it was handed over to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.

8,Masterpieces,"<i>Portrait of Lisa Gherardini</i>, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, known as the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (the <i>Joconde</i> in French)",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo?selection=44909,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-portrait-de-lisa-gherardini-epouse-de-francesco-del-giocondo-dite-monna-lisa-la-gioconda-ou-la-jocon.jpg?1527831862,"
This portrait was doubtless started in Florence around 1503. It is thought to be of Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine cloth merchant named Francesco del Giocondo - hence the alternative title, La Gioconda. However, Leonardo seems to have taken the completed portrait to France rather than giving it to the person who commissioned it. After his death, the painting entered François I's collection.

	Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco Giocondo
The history of the Mona Lisa is shrouded in mystery. Among the aspects which remain unclear are the exact identity of the sitter, who commissioned the portrait, how long Leonardo worked on the painting, how long he kept it, and how it came to be in the French royal collection.
	The portrait may have been painted to mark one of two events - either when Francesco del Giocondo and his wife bought their own house in 1503, or when their second son, Andrea, was born in December 1502 after the death of a daughter in 1499. The delicate dark veil that covers Mona Lisa's hair is sometimes considered a mourning veil. In fact, such veils were commonly worn as a mark of virtue. Her clothing is unremarkable. Neither the yellow sleeves of her gown, nor her pleated gown, nor the scarf delicately draped round her shoulders are signs of aristocratic status.

	A new artistic formula
The Mona Lisa is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait. The painting is generous enough in its dimensions to include the arms and hands without them touching the frame. The portrait is painted to a realistic scale in the highly structured space where it has the fullness of volume of a sculpture in the round. The figure is shown in half-length, from the head to the waist, sitting in a chair whose arm is resting on balusters. She is resting her left arm on the arm of the chair, which is placed in front of a loggia, suggested by the parapet behind her and the two fragmentary columns framing the figure and forming a ""window"" looking out over the landscape. The perfection of this new artistic formula explains its immediate influence on Florentine and Lombard art of the early 16th century. Such aspects of the work as the three-quarter view of a figure against a landscape, the architectural setting, and the hands joined in the foreground were already extant in Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly in the works of Hans Memling. However, the spacial coherence, the atmospheric illusionism, the monumentality, and the sheer equilibrium of the work were all new. In fact, these aspects were also new to Leonardo's work, as none of his earlier portraits display such controlled majesty.

	An emblematic smile
The Mona Lisa's famous smile represents the sitter in the same way that the juniper branches represent Ginevra Benci and the ermine represents Cecilia Gallerani in their portraits, in Washington and Krakow respectively. It is a visual representation of the idea of happiness suggested by the word ""gioconda"" in Italian. Leonardo made this notion of happiness the central motif of the portrait: it is this notion which makes the work such an ideal. The nature of the landscape also plays a role. The middle distance, on the same level as the sitter's chest, is in warm colors. Men live in this space: there is a winding road and a bridge. This space represents the transition between the space of the sitter and the far distance, where the landscape becomes a wild and uninhabited space of rocks and water which stretches to the horizon, which Leonardo has cleverly drawn at the level of the sitter's eyes.

The youthful face stands out against a blue-gray background. Shown almost frontally, its perfect oval is set off by the regular lines of the drawn-back hair and the semicircle of the plait, from which emerges the gold head of a hairpin. The pearly flesh-tints with their pink touches are applied in small close-packed strokes. The large eyes look to the right, brought to life by two touches of white. Gold leaf hides a slender neck adorned by a pearl necklace.
A fascinating face
Her eyes turned to the right, the young woman does not look directly at the viewer. This detail, very rare in a mummy portrait, certainly contributes to her fascination. She is dressed in a purple tunic and a yellow cloak, which is fastened with a round brooch set with a large emerald. The large, prominent, and somewhat pointed ears are adorned with earrings each consisting of a dark stone set between two large pearls. A gold-headed hairpin fastens the plait at the crown of the head. Beneath the gold leaf applied to the neck, laboratory analysis has revealed a simple pearl necklace.
Gold, symbol of immortality
The portrait is painted on a wooden board, originally rectangular, cut to match the shape of the mummy, this distinctive form apparently being characteristic of the city of Antinoöpolis. Over this were applied several small squares of gold leaf, which cover the neck and part of the clothing, without however masking the oval of the face.The shine of gold, resembling that of the sun, made it a magical metal, a symbol of immortality. It was often applied to mummy portraits to cover the gray background around the head, the stucco frame around the portrait, or as here, to hide the neck. It never, however, obscures the features of the face, for the individuality of the deceased had to be preserved.
Exceptional technique
This portrait is painted on cedar, an imported wood. This was first covered with a black preparatory coat, on which the portrait was then painted in encaustic. The painter has exploited to the full the density of the wax, laying down fine, close-packed strokes which follow the modeling of the face, the curve of the eyebrows, and the arrangement of the hair. The eyelashes are rendered by scraping away the encaustic with a hard pointed tool to reveal the black ground beneath.

This portrait of the artist was painted by Dürer when he was twenty-two years old, at the end of his trade guild tour of Germany. It is one of the very first independent self-portraits in Western painting. The thistle held by the artist is possibly a pledge of fidelity to his fiancée Agnes Frey, or perhaps an allusion to Christ's Passion (or more specifically to the spikes on the crown of thorns). 
One of the very first independent self-portraits
After serving his apprenticeship in his home town of Nuremberg, the young Dürer left to make a guild tour through southern Germany. This self-portrait dates from 1493 when he was twenty-two years old and probably in Strasbourg. In choosing to paint his own image, Dürer chose a unique subject: this was one of the very first independent self-portraits in Western painting. It is true that since the end of the Middle Ages painters had begun depicting themselves in their works (they were easily recognizable from the way they looked directly at the spectator). However, these self-portraits were only secondary elements in large compositions that usually had a religious subject. 
A realistic and sophisticated portrait
This portrait takes the form of a bust seen from a three-quarters angle against a dark background, and its composition is entirely consistent with the painting tradition of the time. The pose is a little awkward because the painter has constantly had to look at himself in the mirror. He is wearing sophisticated clothes: a little red cap with pompoms and an elegant overgarment of bluish gray which contrasts with the whiteness of the chemise with its wide embroidered neckline. The face still has some of the childish features seen in his early drawing of a Self-Portrait (1484, Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna), but the manly neck, the strong nose, and the vigorous hands are already those of an adult. Dürer, who was also an excellent engraver, composed his works in a very graphic fashion. The almost metallic fineness of detail, seen in the prickles of the thistle, also recalls his early training as a goldsmith. 
An engagement present or an allusion to Christ?
One interpretation of this self-portrait, which is said to stem from Goethe, is that it was an engagement present for Agnes Frey, whom Dürer was going to marry on his return to Nuremberg in 1494. In fact, the thistle held by the artist is called ""Mannstreu"" in German, which also means ""husband's fidelity."" This pledge of love would also explain the elegance of the costume. The main loophole in this hypothesis is that Dürer may still have been completely unaware of the marriage, which had been arranged by his father. Combined with the inscription on the picture next to the date, ""Things happen to me as it is written on high,"" the thistle could also be seen as a reference to Christ's Passion (or more specifically to the spikes on the crown of thorns). In this case, the work would be a forerunner of his Self-Portrait of 1500 (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), in which Dürer appears as the Salvator Mundi, the Savior of the World, a Christ-like figure crowned with the glory of God. Whatever the case, this self-portrait, combining as it does an artist's pride with very human humility, reveals the new social status to which painters now aspired. Dürer here demonstrates that art had evolved from the medieval tradition to a new phase, making him the first painter of the German Renaissance.

The only diurnal painting by Georges de La Tour in the Louvre along with the Saint Thomas, the Cheat illustrates a theme that was frequently taken up in the wake of Caravaggio. The young man is subjected here to three major temptations according to 17th-century moral standards: gambling, wine, and lust. Another version with notable variations is known to exist, the Cheat with the Ace of Clubs (Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum).
1972, the year of La Tour’s renaissance
One of George de La Tour’s masterpieces and a classic of French painting, the Cheat occupies a particular place among the artist’s works for several reasons. Purchased in 1926 by Paul Landry from an antique dealer on the Île Saint-Louis, the painting bearing the artist’s handsome signature, was made public by Hermann Voss, in 1931, in an article that was to deliver the artist from the depths of oblivion. In this respect, the Louvre painting is one of La Tour’s “firsts.” In 1934, the Cheat featured in the memorable exhibition of the Painters of Reality (Peintres de la réalité) that brought French 17th-century painting back to glory and marked the revival of Georges de La Tour. This sparked a growing craze for the artist and the corpus of his works broadened. Lastly, the year 1972 saw the first monographic exhibition devoted to the painter. It was a huge success and, on this occasion, Landry donated the work to the Musée du Louvre.
The fleecing of the young man
Four figures are gathered around a table and are playing cards. They all seem to be suspended in time. On the right, a lavishly dressed man is going through his cards. He is set apart from the other figures and does not share in their complicity, which is visible in their sidelong glances. Slightly off-center, a woman with a sophisticated hairstyle and plunging neckline beckons us with her eyes and hand position toward the left side of the composition where another player, plunged in shadow, is discreetly producing an ace of diamonds from under his belt. To complete the scene, a maidservant is preparing a glass of wine between him and the courtesan. The situation seems quite clear. The young man, drawn into the game by the courtesan not lacking in assets, is intoxicated and will be divested of his possessions by the man on the left. The painting reworks a subject introduced by Caravaggio in a work currently in the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the companion piece to the Fortune Teller in the Louvre by the same artist. A canvas similar in subject painted by La Tour (Metropolitan Museum, New York) formed the pendant to the composition in the Louvre, or more probably to an earlier version of it, also in Forth Worth.
Dialogues with the 20th century
In the simplified volumes, the oddness of the composition, and the comical aspect of the subject matter, the Louvre’s Cheat found pride of place in 20th-century sensibility. It is easy to imagine how this work must have fascinated the Cubists in its treatment of mass or the Surrealists with its mysterious character, as did another painting a few years its predecessor: Gabrielle d’Estrées and One of Her Sisters, an anonymous work from the second school of Fontainebleau (Louvre).

Jacques Louis David was commissioned by Napoleon I to paint this huge canvas which depicts the splendor of the emperor’s Coronation while conveying its political and symbolic message. The painter himself was present at the ceremony, and once back in his studio portrayed the colorful congregation with realism, combining accuracy with artistry while also complying with the Emperor’s instructions. He thus met the challenge of producing a monumental work that would glorify the event and occupy a unique place in the history of painting.
A double coronation
Having won military prestige with his victorious campaigns in Italy and Egypt, Napoleon took power as First Consul after the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire. In May 1804 he was proclaimed Emperor, and a coronation ceremony was held on December 2 of the same year at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris to secure his imperial legitimacy and root his authority in the French monarchic and Catholic tradition. Moreover—like Charlemagne some 1000 years before—he was consecrated emperor by a pope. However, Napoleon crowned himself, facing the congregation rather than the high altar to mark his independence from the Church. Although David's initial sketch represented the Emperor in the act of crowning himself, the final painting shows him crowning the Empress—a gesture that presents a nobler, less authoritarian image, described by Napoleon himself as that of a ""French knight.""
A blend of art and history
David drew inspiration for the layout of his painting from Rubens's Coronation of Marie de Medici (in the Louvre). He witnessed the ceremony first-hand and had most of its participants pose for him, also reconstructing the scene in his purpose-built studio with cardboard models and wax figurines. He highlighted the protagonists by placing them in the center and illuminating them with a beam of light. The arcade provides an imposing frame for the imperial couple, also set off by the surrounding colorful congregation. The Pope sits to the right among cardinals and bishops. The great dignitaries of the Empire are shown in three-quarter back view in the right foreground, bearing symbols of imperial power: the eagle-topped scepter, the globe, and the hand of Justice. The Emperor's two brothers and two sisters are represented on the left, while Napoleon's mother looks down on the scene from her vantage point in the VIP gallery. All eyes are turned toward the crown, which the painter highlighted against a section of green curtain that overlaps the pilaster. The profile of the kneeling Joséphine—made to look younger for the occasion—stands out against the lovely yellow ocher of the cross-bearer’s cope, just in front of Marshal Murat, who is portrayed holding the coronation cushion. David used an exceptionally rich palette of colors to depict the velvets, furs, satins, and lamés of the costumes and furnishings.
""One walks in this picture""
This painting—which is also a group portrait of the imperial family, the court, and the clergy dressed in ceremonial costume—is totally realistic in appearance. Yet David took certain liberties with history and protocol: he downsized the structure of Notre-Dame Cathedral to give the figures greater impact; on Napoleon’s orders, he included Letizia Bonaparte (“Madame Mère”) in his painting, although she had not attended the coronation ceremony, of which she disapproved; again on the Emperor’s instructions, he portrayed the Pope making a gesture of blessing, having originally represented him with his hands on his knees; and the Emperor’s sisters stand immobile, though they held the Empress's train at the ceremony itself. These various artistic solutions, designed to suit this monumental painting and its fascinating hero, fully satisfied the Emperor: ""What relief, what truthfulness! This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" David realized the significance of this work for the future and for his personal fame, saying ""I shall slide into posterity in the shadow of my hero.""

Painted retable, perhaps commissioned by the Gaddi family, for one of the altars of the monastery of San Domenico in Fiesole (near Florence), where the artist later served as prior. The studied perspective and the physicality of the figures attest to the influence of Masaccio on the young Fra Angelico.
The Coronation of the Virgin
Based on apocryphal texts, the Coronation theme was widely disseminated in the 13th century through Jacobus De Voragine's Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend). The episode follows the Assumption and describes the celestial welcome of the Virgin by Christ, who lifts her above the multitude of the blessed. By way of nine marble steps of various colors, the Virgin climbs to Christ's throne, where a place to His right has been reserved for her. Kneeling with her head bowed, the Virgin receives the crown from the hands of her Son in glory. They are surrounded by the heavenly host, composed of angel musicians and saints, some of whose names appear engraved on their respective haloes; others are identifiable by their attributes. In the foreground, from left to right: St. Louis of France with his fleur-de-lys crown; Mary Magdalene, in red with her hair loose and holding a vase of perfume; St. Catherine of Alexandria with the wheel of her martyrdom; and St. Agnes, holding a lamb to her breast.
A Dominican commission
Several Dominicans, the patrons of this work, are recognizable by their white robes and black mantles. St. Dominic appears in profile; he holds a lily and above his head shines a red star. The martyred St. Peter is depicted with a bleeding wound on his head. The theologian St. Thomas Aquinas is also present, holding his writings and pointing to the scene. On the predella are scenes referring to episodes in the life of the order's founder: The Dream of Innocent III, Saints Peter and Paul Appearing to St. Dominic, St. Dominic Restoring Napoleone Orsini, Christ in the Tomb, The Dispute of St. Dominic and the Miracle of the Book, St. Dominic and his Companions Fed by Angels, and The Death of St. Dominic.
Fra Angelico and his times
The composition is based on the pyramidal structure of the steps and the figures of the Virgin and Christ. The space has been determined according to the laws of linear perspective; these define the angle of the paving stones, which converge at a point above the vase of Mary Magdalene. The space is coherent, each figure placed in such a way that all can be seen. The sculptural volume of the bodies, whose monumentality is accentuated by the low point of view, is reminiscent of the works of Masaccio, which Fra Angelico had the opportunity to contemplate in Florence. Unlike Masaccio, however, Fra Angelico rejected idealized architecture in favor of an aedicula with Gothic forms. The delicate modeling of the faces was inspired by that of Gentile da Fabriano and the color scheme by the palette of Lorenzo Monaco.

The book in the foreground, probably the Bible, sets the model's activity in the traditional context of morality infused with religion. The woman (who is not, as has been unfoundedly claimed, Vermeer's wife) is not wearing work clothes. The marvelously colored cushion on the left is a sewing cushion, used to store sewing materials. The concentration of the model and the play of colors against the light gray background make this one of Vermeer's masterpieces.
Everyday morality
Renoir considered this masterpiece, which entered the Louvre in 1870, the most beautiful painting in the world, along with Watteau's Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera, also in the Louvre. A young lacemaker, undoubtedly a member of the Delft bourgeoisie, is hunched intently over her work, deftly manipulating bobbins, pins and thread on her sewing table. The theme of the lacemaker, frequently depicted in Dutch literature and painting (notably by Caspar Netscher) traditionally illustrated feminine domestic virtues. The small book in the foreground is probably the Bible, which reinforces the picture's moral and religious interpretation. But this is also, as in Vermeer's famous Milkmaid (circa 1658, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), one of the peeks into domestic privacy that so fascinated him. He loved to observe the everyday objects around him and paint different combinations of them in his works: he used the same piece of furniture and Dutch carpet with leaf motifs in several of his pictures.    
Gentle intimacy
The painting's intense intimacy stems both from its small format (this is the smallest painting Vermeer painted) and the central framing of the figure. The Delft master's genius consisted in reproducing the natural optical deformations of the human eye by creating several depths of field. The center of our attention, the lacemaker's painstaking work, is shown in great detail and in sharp focus, particularly the fine white thread stretched between the young woman's fingers. Further away from this visual focus, the forms become more blurred, including, paradoxically, those in the foreground. The white and red threads hanging out of the cushion are rendered in almost abstract dribbles of paint. The tapestry, painted with little ""pointillist"" dabs of pure color, is also out of focus. The harmonious color of this pictorial gem, so characteristic of Vermeer, fascinated Van Gogh, who in a letter to Émile Bernard in 1888 noted the beauty of its "" lemon yellow, pale blue and pearl gray arrangement."" 
The silent poetry of light
Yet, despite the illusion of immediate proximity with the lacemaker, we cannot really penetrate her universe. The forms of the tapestry, sewing cushion and small table come between us and her, and her work is hidden in her right hand. Vermeer's pictures have a ""poetry of silence"" which places his figures, caught in an intimate, impalpable moment, in a world removed from ours, in a clear, gentle brightness that seems to cling to objects in soft specks of light.

The Raft of the Medusa—a major work in French 19th-century painting—is generally regarded as an icon of Romanticism. It depicts an event whose human and political aspects greatly interested Géricault: the wreck of a French frigate off the coast of Senegal in 1816, with over 150 soldiers on board. The painter researched the story in detail and made numerous sketches before deciding on his definitive composition, which illustrates the hope of rescue.
A contemporary event
Géricault drew his inspiration from the account of two survivors of the Medusa—a French Royal Navy frigate that set sail in 1816 to colonize Senegal. It was captained by an officer of the Ancien Régime who had not sailed for over twenty years and who ran the ship aground on a sandbank. Due to the shortage of lifeboats, those who were left behind had to build a raft for 150 souls—a construction that drifted away on a bloody 13-day odyssey that was to save only 10 lives. The disaster of the shipwreck was made worse by the brutality and cannibalism that ensued. 
Géricault decided to represent the vain hope of the shipwrecked sailors: the rescue boat is visible on the horizon—but sails away without seeing them. 
The whole composition is oriented toward this hope in a rightward ascent culminating in a black figure, the figurehead of the boat. The painting stands as a synthetic view of human life abandoned to its fate.
Dissecting the subject
Géricault spent a long time preparing the composition of this painting, which he intended to exhibit at the Salon of 1819. He began by amassing documentation and questioning the survivors, whom he sketched; he then worked with a model and wax figurines, studied severed cadavers in his studio, used friends as models, and hesitated between a number of subjects. The result of this long preparatory period can be seen in two sketches now in the Louvre (RF 2229, RF 1667). There followed the period of solitary work in his studio, spent getting to grips with a vast canvas measuring five meters by seven. 
The pallid bodies are given cruel emphasis by a Caravaggio-style chiaroscuro; some writhe in the elation of hope, while others are unaware of the passing ship. The latter include two figures of despair and solitude: one mourning his son, the other bewailing his own fate. These figures reflect the Romantic inspiration that fueled the work of both Géricault and Gros, and the former's admiration for the latter (see The Plague-Stricken in Jaffa).
A hint of scandal
Géricault's Raft was the star at the Salon of 1819: ""It strikes and attracts all eyes"" (Le Journal de Paris). Critics were divided: the horror and ""terribilità"" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a ""pile of corpses,"" whose realism they considered a far cry from the ""ideal beauty"" incarnated by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea (which triumphed the same year). Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin was categorical: ""Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.""
The painting had fervent admirers too, including Auguste Jal who praised its political theme, its liberal position (the advancement of the ""negro"", the critique of ultra-royalism), and its modernity. For Michelet, ""our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa [...].""

Painted for Cardinal Luigi Omodei. The subject, taken from Plutarch's life of Romulus, illustrates the moment when the Romans seize the Sabine women in order to take them for their wives.Poussin painted an initial version of this composition circa 1635 (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art).
The painting and its double
According to Bellori, the Italian biographer of Poussin, the canvas was painted for Cardinal Aluigi Omodei, who kept it until his death in 1685. His inheritors then sold it to Louis XIV. The king was anxious to build up a collection of the artist's works - despite his absence from the Parisian scene (he lived in Italy all his life except for a stay in Paris between 1640 and 1642), Poussin was still a model for the painters of the Académie. He had already completed a composition on the same theme in 1633-34 for Maréchal de Créqui, who was then on a mission to Rome. This first version is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The same subjects were often painted by Poussin after an interval of several years, so this is not an isolated example. It means we are able to judge his ability to inject new life into his compositions, the most famous example being that of the Sacraments, where he executed two series of seven paintings.
Women for the greatness of Rome
The painting depicts one of the mythical episodes surrounding the history of ancient Rome. The city has just been founded by Romulus, and the Romans wish to ensure the future prosperity of their young nation. As there is a lack of women to provide the necessary offspring, they plan a mass abduction. With this in mind, they invite the neighboring Sabines to a feast during which they seize the women and drive off the men. Three years later, the Sabines attack Rome in revenge. But the conflict is prevented thanks to the women, who stand between their brothers and their husbands (to whom they have become reconciled). Thus peace was achieved between the two peoples. Poussin has chosen to illustrate the scene of the abduction. Romulus stands on the left, dominating the proceedings, in a pose directly inspired by Imperial statues. In the central section, the painter emphasizes the panic and confrontation between the men and women. This all takes place against an architectural background in linear perspective, which gives the work its vanishing point. Also of interest is the way the artist has organized the figures, using two diagonal lines that start from the edges of the picture and join up where there is a gap in the landscape, thus making the work more dynamic.  
Bodies intertwined
The theme of abduction was popular from the sixteenth century onwards. It allowed male and female bodies to be merged with one another, as in sculpture, but also enabled a variety of expressions to be depicted and, especially in painting, to give an impression of crowds and panic. So it was a theme rich in opportunities for three-dimensional effects achieved through the interaction of solid objects with the surrounding space. Among such episodes telling stories of abductions, the most frequent ones, apart from the Sabine women, are those of Helen by Paris, Europa by Zeus, Deianira by the centaur Nessus, and Persephone by Hades, which can be seen in a sculpture by Bernini. Poussin probably drew inspiration from this for the group in the foreground on the left.

Michelangelo undertook the project for the tomb of Pope Julius II in 1505, and began to carve the Slaves in 1513, as part of a modified project. On the pope's death, the project changed once again, for financial reasons.
	Michelangelo donated the Slaves to Roberto Strozzi, who brought them to France.

	Opposing emotions

	The two chained slaves express entirely different emotions. The one known as the Dying Slave is superbly young and handsome, and apparently in a deep (perhaps eternal) sleep. The other, called the Rebellious Slave, is a coarser figure whose whole body seems engaged in a violent struggle. Michelangelo intended both statues for the splendid funerary monument originally planned for and by Pope Julius II — a project which was repeatedly modified during forty years of successive programs.
	The iconographical theme is something of a mystery; there are few clues, beyond the figure of a monkey which is roughed out beside the dying slave. Do these captive figures symbolize the subjugated provinces? Or the Arts, reduced to slavery by the pontiff's death? Perhaps they have a role to play in his eternal triumph? Should they be interpreted as enslaved passions, or (in accordance with the Platonic theme which inspired Michelangelo) do they represent the human soul, burdened by the body? An extraordinary force emanates from these tormented bodies — whose state of incompletion reinforces the impression of power.

	Origin of the statues

	The slaves were designed as part of the initial project for the tomb (in 1505), and Michelangelo began to carve them in 1513 when a second project was developed. A fourth, less grandiose project, elaborated after the pope's death, saw them rejected for financial reasons. Julius II, who had dreamed of a freestanding mausoleum at Saint Peter's in Rome, was buried in San Pietro in Vincoli in a wall tomb, albeit one adorned with Michelangelo's famous Moses (a contemporary of the slaves). Despite being unfinished, the two great marbles were already admired. Michelangelo donated them to the Florentine exile Roberto Strozzi, who presented them to the French king.
	The Slaves thus reached France during the sculptor's lifetime, and first occupied two niches at the Château d'Ecouen (constructed by the constable Anne de Montmorency) before Cardinal de Richelieu took them to his château in Poitou. The two Slaves had originally been intended to feature on the pope's tomb alongside similar figures, including the four marble Slaves in the Academy of Florence, carved (and also left incomplete) in 1531–32.

	Incompletion

	Were the Slaves unfinished for technical reasons? The grain of the marble on the Rebellious Slave's face and the thinness of the base beneath the figures' lower feet no doubt explain that the works were abandoned. However, non-finito was a recurrent theme with Michelangelo, who played on the opposition between the shine on the smooth, impeccable body of the Dying Slave, and the rough surface of raw marble. In his quest for absolute truth in art, he abandoned a work when he felt he could not attain his ideal. He thus left the marks of his tools (hammers, chisels, rasps, gradines and trepans) clearly visible — living traces of his tireless fight with raw material, which he worked relentlessly in his quest to liberate the figure imprisoned within.

Almost everyone has seen this image of the Seated Scribe. Located on the upper floor of the Department of Egyptian Antiquities, this is the most famous of unknown figures. We know nothing about the person portrayed: neither his name, nor title, nor even the exact period during which he lived. Nevertheless, this statue never fails to impress visitors discovering it for the first time.
A specific posture
The Louvre's scribe, known as the ""Seated Scribe"", is indeed sitting cross-legged, his right leg crossed in front of his left. The white kilt, stretched over his knees, serves as a support. He is holding a partially rolled papyrus scroll in his left hand. His right hand must have held a brush, now missing. The most striking aspect of this sculpture is the face, particularly the elaborately inlaid eyes: they consist of a piece of red-veined white magnesite, in which a piece of slightly truncated rock crystal was placed. The front part of the crystal was carefully polished. The back side was covered with a layer of organic material, creating the color of the iris and also probably serving as an adhesive. The entire eye was then held in the socket by two large copper clips welded on the back. A line of black paint defines the eyebrows. The hands, fingers, and fingernails are sculpted with a remarkable delicacy. His chest is broad and the nipples are marked by two wooden dowels. The statue was cleaned in 1998, although the process merely reduced the wax overpainting. This restoration brought out the well-conserved ancient polychromy.
An unknown figure
The semicircular base on which the figure sits must have originally fit into a larger base that carried his name and titles, such as the base for the statue of Prince Setka, exhibited in room 22 of the Louvre. This base is missing, and the context of the discovery does not provide any additional information. According to the archeologist Auguste Mariette, who found the work, the statue of the scribe was apparently discovered in Saqqara on 19 November 1850, to the north of the Serapeum's line of sphinxes. But the precise location is not known; unfortunately, the documents concerning these excavations were published posthumously, the excavation journals had been lost, and the archives were scattered between France and Egypt. Furthermore, the site had been pillaged and ransacked, and no information concerning the figure's identity could be provided. Some historians have tried to link it to one of the owners of the statues discovered at the same time. The most convincing of these associates the scribe to Pehernefer. Certain stylistic criteria, such as the thin lips, which was unusual, the form of the torso, and the broad chest could support this theory. The statue of Pehernefer dates from the 4th Dynasty. This is an additional argument in favor of an earlier dating for this statue, which has sometimes been dated to the 6th Dynasty. Another argument supporting this date is that ""writing"" scribes were mostly created in the 4th and early 5th Dynasties; after this period, most scribes were portrayed in ""reading"" poses.
A scribe at work
The scribe is portrayed at work, which is unusual in Egyptian statuary. Although no king was ever portrayed in this pose, it seems that it was originally used for members of the royal family, such as the king's sons or grandsons, as was the case for the sons of Didufri (4th Dynasty), who were represented in this position.

In 1553, Veronese was summoned to Venice where he gave free rein to his decorative talent in vast canvases that blended masterful composition, splendid contemporary costumes, and luminous colors. The Wedding Feast at Cana graced the refectory designed by Palladio for the Benedictine monastery on the Venetian island of San Giorgio Maggiore. With masterly freedom of interpretation, Veronese transposed the biblical episode to the sumptuous setting of a Venetian wedding.
A biblical scene within a Venetian banquet
In Cana, Galilee, Christ is invited to a wedding feast during which he performs his first miracle. At the end of the banquet, when the wine is running low, he asks the servants to fill the stone jars with water and then offer them to the master of the house, who finds that the water has been turned to wine. This episode, told by the Apostle John, is a precursor of the Eucharist. The bride and groom are seated at the left end of the table, leaving the center place to the figure of Christ. He is surrounded by the Virgin, his disciples, clerks, princes, Venetian noblemen, Orientals in turbans, several servants, and the populace. Some figures are dressed in traditional antique costumes, while others—the women in particular—wear sumptuous coiffures and adornments. Veronese depicts, with apparent ease, no less than 130 feast-goers, mixing biblical figures with men and women of the period. The latter are not really identifiable, although according to an 18th-century legend, the artist himself is depicted in white with a viola da gamba next to Titian and Bassano, all of whom contribute to the musical entertainment. The bearded master of ceremonies could be Aretino, whom Veronese greatly admired. Several dogs, birds, a parakeet, and a cat frolic amidst the crowd.  
The sacred and the profane
Veronese mixes the sacred and the profane in establishing the decor. Religious symbols of the Passion are found next to luxurious 16th-century silver vessels and tableware. The furniture, the dresser, the ewer, and the crystal goblets and vases reveal the feast in all its splendor. Each table guest has an individual place setting, complete with napkin, fork, and knife. In this doubling of meaning, no detail escapes the artist's eye. While in the center of the composition a servant slices meat, symbolic of the body of Christ, quinces—symbols of marriage—are served as dessert to the guests. Veronese orchestrates a veritable mise-en-scène. The theme allows him to create a theatrical decor in which to place his figures. The composition is divided into two sections: in the upper part, clouds skate across a blue sky; in the lower, terrestrial section, there is the bustling crowd of people. The fluted columns topped with Corinthian capitals evoke the recent constructions of the architect Palladio. The painter selected costly pigments imported from the Orient by Venetian merchants: yellow-oranges, vivid reds, and lapis lazuli are used extensively in the drapery and the sky. These colors play a major role in the painting's legibility; they contribute, by their contrasts, to the individualization of each of the figures. Thanks to a three-year restoration, the colors have regained their force and brilliance, sometimes even undergoing complete modification as in the case of the master of ceremony's mantle, which was changed from red to green—its original hue.
The commission
The Benedictines of the San Giorgio Maggiore monastery in Venice commissioned this immense painting in 1562 to decorate their new refectory. The contract engaging Veronese in the undertaking of the Wedding Feast was extremely precise. The monks insisted that the work be monumental, in order to fill the entire end wall of the refectory. Hung at a height of 2.5 meters from the ground, it was designed to create an illusion of extended space. This work of 70 m² occupied Veronese for 15 months, most likely with the assistance of his brother Benedetto Caliari. The commission was a turning point in Veronese's career; after the painting's success, other religious communities would clamor for a similar work in their own monasteries. Despite its exceptional dimensions, the painting was confiscated, rolled up, and shipped to Paris by Napoleon's troops in 1797.

The winged goddess of Victory standing on the prow of a ship overlooked the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace. This monument was probably an ex-voto offered by the people of Rhodes in commemoration of a naval victory in the early second century BC. The theatrical stance, vigorous movement, and billowing drapery of this Hellenistic sculpture are combined with references to the Classical period-prefiguring the baroque aestheticism of the Pergamene sculptors.

	A presentation mixing grandeur and theatricality
This exceptional monument was unearthed in 1863 on the small island of Samothrace in the northwest Aegean. It was discovered by Charles Champoiseau, French Vice-Consul to Adrianople (Turkey). The goddess of Victory (Nike, in Greek) is shown in the form of a winged woman standing on the prow of a ship, braced against the strong wind blowing through her garments. With her right hand cupped around her mouth, she announced the event she was dedicated to commemorate. The colossal work was placed in a rock niche that had been dug into a hill; it overlooked the theater of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. This niche may also have contained a pool filled with water in which the ship appeared to float. Given its placement, the work was meant to be viewed from the front left-hand side; this explains the disparity in sculpting technique, the right side of the body being much less detailed. The highly theatrical presentation-combined with the goddess's monumentality, wide wingspan, and the vigor of her forward-thrusting body-reinforces the reality of the scene.

	A commemorative Rhodian monument
The sanctuary at Samothrace was consecrated to the Cabeiri, gods of fertility whose help was invoked to protect seafarers and to grant victory in war. The offering of a statue of Nike perched on a ship was a religious act in honor of these gods. It has also been suggested that this monument was dedicated by the Rhodians in commemoration of a specific naval victory. The type of ship depicted and the gray marble used for the prow and base of the statue both suggest that this is indeed a Rhodian creation. If it is associated with a major Rhodian naval victory, the work can be dated to the second century BC-it would have been erected in honor of the battle of Myonnisos, or perhaps the Rhodian victory at Side in 190 BC against the fleet of Antiochus III of Syria.

	A Hellenistic work steeped in tradition
The Winged Victory of Samothrace is one of the masterpieces of Hellenistic sculpture. The figure creates a spiraling effect in a composition that opens out in various directions. This is achieved by the oblique angles of the wings and the placement of the left leg, and emphasized by the clothing blowing between the goddess's legs. The nude female body is revealed by the transparency of the wet drapery, much in the manner of classical works from the fifth century BC, while the cord worn just beneath the breasts recalls a clothing style that was popular beginning in the fourth century. In the treatment of the tunic-sometimes brushing against the body, sometimes billowing in the wind-the sculptor has been remarkably skillful in creating visual effects. The decorative richness, sense of volume, and intensity of movement are characteristic of a Rhodian style that prefigures the baroque creations of the Pergamene school (180-160 BC).

Ingres transposed the theme of the mythological nude, whose long tradition went back to the Renaissance, to an imaginary Orient. This work, his most famous nude, was commissioned by Caroline Murat, Napoleon's sister and the queen of Naples. Here, Ingres painted a nude with long, sinuous lines bearing little resemblance to anatomical reality, but rendered the details and texture of the fabrics with sharp precision. This work drew fierce criticism when it was displayed at the Salon of 1819.
Discreetly seductive
This woman lying on a divan is offering herself because she is nude and turns her face towards us. The painting's title, which means ""harem woman,"" and the accessories around her conjure up the sensuous Orient. But the woman is also discreet because she shows only her back and part of one breast. The nude was a major theme in Western art, but since the Renaissance figures portrayed in that way had been drawn from mythology; here Ingres transposed the theme to a distant land. The subject of the odalisque fascinated Boucher in the eighteenth century and was later chosen as a theme by Théodore Chassériau (1819-1856), one of Ingres's pupils. Throughout his career, many of Ingres's works feature Orientalist themes, such as The Turkish Bath (Louvre), which he painted towards the end of his life. The female nude, historical scenes, and the portrait were Ingres's favorite genres.
A nude for a queen
Caroline Murat (1782-1839), Napoleon's sister and the queen of Naples, commissioned this painting in 1813. It was probably a matching piece to another nude, La Dormeuse de Naples, destroyed in 1815. La Grande Odalisque was painted in Rome, where Ingres had arrived in 1806 to complete a fellowship at the Académie de France. The artist remained in Italy until 1824 because his art was unpopular in Paris. The works he exhibited at the Salon of 1806 (Caroline Rivière and Madame Rivière, Louvre), and the paintings he sent from Rome (The Valpinçon Bather, and Oedipus and the Sphinx, Louvre) were criticized. The exhibition of La Grande Odalisque at the Salon of 1819 confirmed that the critics didn't understand Ingres's style. They admonished him for disregarding anatomical reality, which set him apart from his teacher, Jacques Louis David (1748-1825).
Abstraction and objectivity
Draftsmanship was very important to Ingres. He favored long, sinuous lines - for example, the woman's back - creating a work of great beauty and sensuality. The volumes of the nude, bathed in an even light, are toned down in a space without depth. Ingres was influenced by Mannerist painting and, perhaps, by Persian illuminated manuscripts. In contrast with the abstract lines, the rendering of the details, such as the fabrics, is illusionistic. The same paradoxical combination can be found in the art of the great sculptor Antonio Canova (Eros and Psyche, Louvre). The subtle economy of colors also sets this work apart. Ingres treated the sensual motif with a cold harmony set off by the blue drapery. The gold of the other fabrics helps make this odalisque a mysterious, captivating figure.

Human-headed winged bulls were protective genies called shedu or lamassu, and were placed as guardians at certain gates or doorways of the city and the palace. Symbols combining man, bull, and bird, they offered protection against enemies.
A protective genie to guard the city
When in around 713 BC Sargon II founded his capital, Dur Sharrukin, present-day Khorsabad, he enclosed it, together with several palaces, within a great wall of unbaked brick pierced by seven gates. Protective genies were placed on either side of these entrances to act as guardians. They also had a strictly architectural function, as they bore some of the weight of the arch above. The excavations undertaken by Paul Botta, beginning in 1843, saw the site cleared and revealed some of the works, which were sent to the Louvre. The drawings and meticulous surveys done then by Eugène Flandin, to be complemented a decade later by the work of Victor Place, indicate the original position of these winged bulls. This one formed the left jamb of Door K in the palace.
A monumental sculpture
Carved from a single block, it stands more than 4 meters high by 4 meters wide and is a meter in depth. The head is sculpted in the round, the rest of the body in high relief. High relief was much prized in the time of Sargon II, when modeling became more marked.The head, the only human element, whose ears are those of a bull, has a man's bearded face with very precisely modeled features. The eyes are expressive, the thick eyebrows meet above a prominent nose. The kindly mouth is surmounted by a thin mustache. A curly beard covers the jaw and chin, while the hair falls down to the shoulders, framing the face. This human head wears a starred tiara, flanked by pairs of horns and topped by a row of feathers.The body, its anatomy very precisely rendered, is that of a bull: the beast has not four but five legs, so that it looks as if standing still when seen from the front, and as if walking when seen from the side. From the shoulders spring the wings of a bird of prey, only one being visible, curving above the back; broad panels of curls cover the breast, belly, back, and rump. The tail is very long and curly at the end. An inscription on two panels between the hind legs of the bull praises the ruler by rehearsing his virtues and calls down a curse on whomever should seek to harm the edifice.These bulls are motifs of Syrian inspiration and one of the characteristic features of the decoration of Assyrian palaces. They make their first appearance at Nimrud in the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, to disappear again after the reign of Ashurbanipal.

	A classical composition

	Titian has pictured this sensuous young Venetian woman daydreaming at her toilet, holding her rope of hair in one hand and a perfume bottle in the other. She is standing, face-on, and is wearing a green dress with shoulder straps and a loose pleated white blouse which is open, revealing her left shoulder. A bearded man in a red doublet is holding two mirrors for her, one in front and the other behind. The painting is tightly focused on the two figures, which fill the entire space. The classical layout is particularly clear thanks to the harmonious way the forms echo each other. For example, the young woman's oval face and the round mirror echo the curving lines of her unclothed arm, right sleeve, plump shoulders, and generous décolleté.

	A hymn to the beauty of Venetian women

	While in this work Titian is still close to his master Giorgione in the use of the mirror and the trompe-l'oeil shelf the woman's hand is resting on, he is already distancing himself from the master in his use of a rich palette of bright colors and in the subtle play of light and shade, particularly the red garment worn by the man standing in the shadows. The work, painted while Titian was still a young man, reveals his interest in painting female portraits - he produced several such between 1510 and 1520. The young woman is leaning her head slightly to one side, and this, together with her blue eyes, pale complexion, bare shoulders, and loose, wavy, blonde hair, make her an idealized representation of Venetian beauties of the early 16th century. This fashionable theme also inspired a number of other artists, including Palma, Bordoni, and Savoldo.

Augustin Pajou sculpted the portrait of a dreamy young woman, unaware that she is living the last moments of innocence before her tragic destiny unfolds. He portrayed the daughter of Farmer General Jean-Joseph de Laborde a year before her marriage to Count Charles de Noailles, the future Duke de Mouchy. The beauty of the model and the finesse of Pajou's execution make it one of the most beautiful female portraits in 18th-century sculpture.
Terracotta and marble
This beautiful terracotta portrait, sculpted in 1789, shows the daughter of Farmer General Jean-Joseph de Laborde (a rich banker and art lover), a year before her marriage to Count Charles de Noailles, the future Duke de Mouchy. We see the same traits in the marble Augustin Pajou sculpted three years later, Nathalie de Laborde in Filial Piety (private collection), for the park at Méréville (a masterpiece of 18th-century landscape gardening designed by the painter Hubert Robert for de Laborde). Following the example of his master, Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne, Pajou sculpted numerous portrait busts of women.
Calm and innocence before tragedy
The portrait shows a very young, serious-looking woman, still hardly more than a child. Pajou's very sure modeling captures her uniform features and smooth skin, which contrast with her thick hair, whose locks are expertly arranged and tied with a ribbon. Nathalie's sideways gaze gives her a dreamy look. These are the last moments of calm and innocence of a young woman whose tragic destiny would end in her madness. She was imprisoned during the Terror after her husband had fled the country, and her father and most of her husband's family were guillotined. Freed in 1794, she went to England to join her husband, only to find him living with a mistress. He tried to rid himself of her by arranging an intrigue with one his friends. Indignant, she returned to France, where she led a dissolute existence. In 1805 she met Chateaubriand, with whom she had a passionate and stormy affair that ended in 1812. Already mentally unstable, she definitively lost her reason during the Hundred Days, the turbulent period that rekindled the anxiety of the Revolution. She spent the last twenty years of her life in a mental asylum.
One of the most beautiful portraits of its time
This bust's elegant simplicity and finesse of execution make it one of the most beautiful female portraits in 18th-century sculpture. Formerly in the Deutsch de la Meurthe collection, it was bought by the Louvre at auction in 1991. It joined another magnificent female portrait by Pajou, his bust of the famous portrait painter Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun.

The distinctive feature of these small, decorative, turned wood urns is that they hide the profiles of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The two images are not immediately visible, but appear through an optical effect between the lower belly and upper base of each piece.
Urn-shaped vases
The form of these elegant, seemingly identical ornamental vases was inspired by architecture. Each small, ovoid urn stands on a high base resembling the shaft of a column, and is made of finely turned mahogany decorated with gilded bronze. A small chain on the column is held in place by four rings, and the vase is embellished with three rows of beads and two buttons in the place of handles. At the top of each urn is a fixed lid, topped by a bronze pine cone.
Seditious objects
The superb quality of the turning should not distract from the hidden feature of these vases: though innocuous at first glance, they actually hide the profiles of the king and queen which stand out in negative silhouette in the contours of the urns. Their shape, which closely resembles a type of funerary urn, indicates that they were made after 1793—the year of the death of both Louis XVI (January 21) and Marie Antoinette (October 16). 
These items were no doubt commissioned by royalists; they were a means of evoking the royal family, and of paying tribute to a pre-revolutionary age without fear of reprisals. ""Seditious"" engravings were also made, in which figures were hidden.

Marc Antoine Thierry de Ville d'Avray was appointed Intendant Général du Garde-Meuble in May 1784. In July of the same year, he commissioned this rolltop desk for his private use from the cabinetmaker Jean-Henri Riesener. Although the design had been perfected by Jean-François Oeben some twenty years earlier, the desk is a fine example not only of Riesener's expertise but also of the vogue for certain types of furniture which lasted until the end of the Ancien Régime.
Thierry de Ville d'Avray, a discerning patron
This rolltop desk was commissioned from Jean-Henri Riesener by Marc-Antoine Thierry de Ville d'Avray, who had become general manager of the royal furniture in May 1784, on the death of his predecessor, Fontanieu. The desk was ordered in July and delivered three month's later for the large study in Thierry de Ville d'Avray's apartment in the Royal Furniture Repository (now the Admiralty). In May 1785 he sent it to the Château de Fontainebleau for his personal use; it was later used by the count of Provence. As manager of the royal furniture, Thierry de Ville d'Avray was in a good position to choose the period's most brilliant craftsman, then in his last year as royal cabinetmaker.
A lasting design
About 1760 Jean-François Oeben designed a new type of bureau: the rolltop desk. The writing area can be covered by a shutter made of flexible slats, which is rolled round a cylinder hidden behind the top tier of drawers. In the Château de Versailles is found the most famous example of this type of desk, the ""bureau du roi,"" which was begun by Oeben and finished by Riesener. Riesener made several rolltop desks; the one for Thierrry de Ville d'Avray indicates that the Louis XV style was not yet regarded as outmoded in the 1780s. Standing on four slightly curved solid mahogany legs, the desk has an apron with five drawers, a pull-out writing surface on one side, and a roll locked with a key. As with the king's desk, the lock secures both the roll top and the drawers in the apron. The drawers in the frieze, which do not lock with a key, contain a surface that may be propped up and an escritoire made of silvered copper.
Riesener's technique and mechanism
Jean-Henri Riesener was apprenticed to Jean-François Oeben and took over his workshop when Oeben died in 1763. Riesener applied what he had learned from his master to crafting Thierry de Ville d'Avray's desk. The mechanism follows the design perfected by Oeben for his own productions. For the veneer, however, Riesener departed from his training to invent a new decorative approach. He enhanced the bird's-eye mahogany by adding fine gilt-bronze friezes to each panel. Mahogany was not widely used until the late eighteenth century, when its reddish brown color and fine grain began to be appreciated. Riesener made other rolltop desks in a more emphatically Neoclassical style, notably two writing desks for Marie Antoinette, one in the Tuileries and the other in the Château de Fontainebleau.

This drawing was exhibited with other entries the Concours de l'An II, despite having been submitted after the deadline had passed. In this allegorical work illustrating Jacobin ideals through symbolic figures, Vien chose to depict a procession from classical antiquity and imbue it with revolutionary ideas. Wanting to start work on a companion piece, the artist eventually decided to withdraw this drawing before the jury had reached its decision.
Between antiquity and patriotism
The subject chosen by Vien is patriotic, but the vision that he has chosen, inspired by the processions of classical antiquity, takes the form of one of the parades revived by the Revolution. On the left, Mars and Hercules, accompanied by legionaries and lions, serve as a reminder of the national war effort. Hercules draws a chariot, an echo of the triumphal chariots painted by David. A female figure, who does not bear the usual attributes of either the Republic or the Revolution, is seated in the chariot: dressed in classical robes, she brings with her Peace and Plenty, recognizable by the olive branch and the cornucopia. Behind her are Equality, Fraternity and the winged genie of Reason. In the foreground is Nature, accompanied by her children. Flying above the procession, Fame and the Gallic rooster form  a dramatic contrast with the two-headed eagle crushed by the wheels of the chariot. Amid the debris of weapons, flags and wreaths, the triumph of the Republic over the Austrian Empire appears beyond dispute.
The Concours de l'An II
Amid the turmoil of the Revolution, artists struggled to survive and the National Convention took on the role of patron of the arts. When the Committee of Public Education announced the Concours de l'An II (Year II competition), it gave artists one month to submit entries. Vien submitted his work in June, two months late, justifying the delay in a letter in which he stressed that the work represented ""a homage that I hasten to pay to the Law and an example which, in my old age, I believe it is my duty to offer to the young."" Both the submission and the exhibition of the work were somewhat surprising, as it would appear that Vien was neither eager to take part in the competition nor an ardent Jacobin. David is believed to have encouraged him to produce a work of art in honor of the Revolution. In the end, The Triumph of the Revolution did not enter the competition: Vien withdrew it from the Louvre's Salon Carré before the jury reached its verdict, on the pretext that he wanted to produce a companion drawing.
Between reality and allegory
The spatial arrangement of the groups here is also found in other drawings by Vien from around the same time. The soldiers on the left embody patriotic fervor: one veteran soldier is carried aloft by his young companions in arms, the better to be able to marvel at the Republican trinity. This group shows the Republic proclaiming Peace and Plenty, rewarding a wounded soldier and reassuring a ploughman. The bucolic appearance of the figures on the right is underlined by the presence of an ox. The children of Nature, meanwhile, gather up the fruits of Plenty. In this allegory, the Republic is depicted as simultaneously warlike and pastoral. Bringing up the rear of the procession, a radiant youth sporting wings embodies Rousseauesque notions of the new man and regeneration, with little reference to the realities of society at this time. Vien's moderantism is the dominant spirit: there are no symbols of the church or the doomed aristocracy, the people meekly accept the authority embodied by Hercules, and Liberty and Equality remain firmly in the background.

Queen Marie Antoinette purchased the château de Saint-Cloud from the Duke of Orléans in 1785 and furnished it to suit her own taste. This table was in the queen's inner chamber. It was crafted by the cabinetmaker Adam Weisweiler and delivered by the merchant Daguerre, who probably had a hand in the design. The piece is characteristic of Weisweiler's work and of the refinement of the Louis XVI style.
A writing table
This lacquered, ebony-veneered, oblong table has an apron furnished with drawers. The front of the apron is divided into three sections, with the center projecting slightly. The middle and left sections comprise a single large drawer with a hinged flap covered in blue (originally green velvet) that, when raised, reveals the actual drawer. The small right section of the apron is made up of a drawer (which lacks its writing case), containing a gilt copper inkwell, a powder case, and a sponge box. The central section has a rack and pinion on the back, enabling it to be raised like a sloping desktop. When closed, the table seems to become purely decorative.
Lacquer and marquetry
Cabinetwork plays only a small part in the appearance of the table, most of which is veneered wtih Japan lacquer panels encircled with aventurine and set off by gilt-bronze beading. The apron also features materials not commonly used in cabinetmaking, especially steel, which here makes one of its earliest appearances in a piece of furniture. Inside the table, Weisweiler's skill at marquetry becomes apparent: the bottoms and sides of the drawers are inlaid with sycamore diamonds edged with three narrow bands of white, green, and black, and punctuated at the top by four ebony disks. Similar marquetry can be found on the card table made for Marie-Antoinette by Jean Henri Riesener, likewise for the château de Saint-Cloud, and now in the Musée Nissim de Camondo in Paris. With its stretcher composed of cleverly intertwining rods supporting a gilt-bronze openwork basket in the middle, the table is typical of Adam Weisweiller's work.
Lavish and finely executed gilt mounts
The writing table features gilt-bronze decoration, perhaps made by the gilder François Remond whose services Daguerre often called upon. The feet, which are cased, are decorated with canephores enfolded in classical drapery, a motif that recurs throughout Weisweiler's work. The apron is made of polished steel plates highlighted with gilt bronze friezes. The projecting front section is decorated with a mask of Apollo flanked by a pair of winged sphinxes, and by foliated scrolls. The sides feature garlands of flowers and fruits held up by ribbons tied in bows. The delicate chasing and the polychrome effect of the different materials make this table a masterpiece, crafted under the orchestration of Daguerre.

29,Napoleon (1769-1821),Athénienne de Napoléon Ier,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/athenian?selection=44904,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-athenienne-napoleon-ier_0.jpg?1527818083,"
This ""Athenian"" was made for the Consul Napoleon Bonaparte to adorn his chamber in the Palais des Tuileries. Inspired by the ancient Greek tripod, it was executed by the ""tabletier"" Martin-Guillaume Biennais (1764-1843), who had extended his activities to furniture and gold and silverwork after the abolition of the guilds in 1792. It reveals the pervasive taste of the early nineteenth century for antiquity, as well as the personal taste of Napoleon, who took it with him to Sainte-Hélène.
What is an ""Athenian""?
The form of this ""Athenian"" is derived from the ancient Greek tripod, a small, three-legged stand used in antiquity to support a basin. Generally made of bronze, it could also be in copper, silver, stone, or gold. Often a commonplace household item serving as a brazier, it was also used for votive functions, offered in homage to the divinites. The tripod rapidly became a widespread motif in the classical period. An interest in antiquity during the middle of the eighteenth century gave a new lease of life to objects of this kind. In 1773, Jean-Henri Eberts invented a tripod that variously served as pedestal table, incense-burner, chafing dish, or flower stand, which he named an ""Athenian"" in reference to Joseph-Marie Vien's picture, The Virtuous Athenian, in which a Greek woman is to be seen making an offering on a tripod.
A repertoire at once aquatic and antique
The design of this ""Athenian"", the drawing for which was supplied by Charles Percier (1764-1838), is extremely elegant. The legs, made of yew, are finely curved and are surmounted by palm leaves where a swan, modelled in the round, nests in chased gilt bronze. The swans support on their necks and wings a hoop of bronze decorated with a frieze of Vitruvian scrollwork, on which the basin engraved with reeds and oak leaves rests. The tablette between the legs is connected to the feet of the stand by small dies decorated with bees and dolphins. Dolphins and swans belong to a repertoire at once aquatic and antique, thereby illustrating the function of this ""Athenian"" as a washstand. 
A work characteristic of the early nineteenth century
The theme of the swan was fairly widespread during the Consulate and Empire periods. The architect and decorator Berthault chose the motif to decorate Madame Récamier's bed. In the early nineteenth century, the form of the tripod was more than ever in vogue, at a time when taste was steeped in classical culture. Architectural digests, such as that of Percier and Fontaine, include numerous models of furniture of this type. The tripod, however, no longer combines several uses, but, like that of Napoleon, serves as a washstand. The term ""Athenian"" was restricted at the time to luxurious models intended for sovereigns. Biennais made other small washstands and bureaus, and we know of two other ""Athenians"" made by him, now in the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the château de Fontainebleau.

30,Napoleon (1769-1821),Cabaret égyptien de Napoléon Ier,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/36-pieces-egyptian-cabaret-set-napoleon-i?selection=44904,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-cabaret-egyptien-napoleon-ier.jpg?1527818104,"
These thirty-six porcelain pieces decorated with Egyptian motifs are from the cabaret set - or breakfast service - of Napoleon I delivered to the Palais des Tuileries in 1810. This was the fourth cabaret set produced by the Manufacture de Sèvres during the First Empire. It features reproductions of engravings from Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Égypte by Dominique Vivant Denon (1747-1825), thus attesting to the early nineteenth century's fascination with Egyptian civilization.
The seven ""Egyptian cabaret sets""
The Manufacture de Sèvres produced seven cabaret sets. The pieces in the Louvre are from the fourth. Shapes and composition vary from one service to another, as does the ornamentation culled from Dominique Vivant Denon's book on Egypt. The first set was given by Napoleon I to Czar Alexander I in 1808. The second, for Joséphine, is now in the Château de la Malmaison. The third was also delivered to Joséphine at the Palais des Tuileries, and the fourth to Napoleon on March 31, 1810 to be used at the palace. The fifth was given to the Duchess de Montebello in 1813, the sixth to the Duchess de Bassano, and the seventh to the Countess de Luçay. Napoleon enjoyed his set very much. He gave pieces from it to his close relatives and took the rest with him to Saint Helena. 
""Estrucan"" shapes
The shapes of the cabaret set are not in the least Egyptian, but are, for the larger pieces, generally fanciful interpretations of Etruscan vases. The creamer with its trefoil spout is a shape created in 1806. Various pieces from antiquity may have been used as models, such as items from Vivant Denon's collection, which was sold in 1786. The ""Pestum"" sugar pots were some of the first created after Brongniart was made head of the Manufacture de Sèvres in 1800. The ""Etruscan"" pot with handles first appeared in 1806. Its name implies it was inspired by an ancient model. The milk jug with its long spout, also designed in 1806, may likewise be inspired by antiquity. The shape of the ""litron"" cups, little cylindrical cups with a handle, dates back to the early years of the Manufacture de Vincennes and is still used today.
Egyptian-style ornamentation
Napoleon's 1798 Egyptian campaign was popularized by publications that enabled the French public to discover Egyptian civilization and helped brush the military defeat aside. Dominique Vivant Denon had convinced Napoleon to let him come along. He brought back the watercolors that were published in his book Le Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Égypte (six reprints between 1802 and 1810). Another book, La Description de l'Égypte, published by the Institut d'Égypte, also presented the result of his studies. Architects and craftsmen used these illustrated compilations for inspiration. A wave of ""Egyptomania"" swept over the decorative arts in France during the  Consulate and First Empire. The cups of Napoleon I's cabaret set are decorated with square panels depicting views of Egypt painted by Lebel, including the temple of Tentyra, the pyramid of Maydum, the city of Thebes, the island of Philae, or the lighthouse of Alexandria. On the saucers, Béranger painted the heads of local figures (a Bedouin, a sheikh, a Coptic monk) in sepia. Under each portrait is a caption in gold letters (the gilding is the work of Micaud fils). All the objects on blue ground are enhanced with decorative friezes of hieroglyphics.

31,Napoleon (1769-1821),Central medallion from the Carpet in the Throne Room at the Palais des Tuileries,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/central-medallion-carpet?selection=44904,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-medaillon-central-tapis-salle.jpg?1527828899,"
This medallion made up the center of the great carpet in the throne room at the Palais des Tuileries. Delivered in 1810  for the marriage ceremony of Napoleon I and Marie-Louise, it is decorated with the symbols of the Empire. The decoration fell into disfavor under the Restoration, and the carpet was cut up. The medallion in the Louvre gives some clue to what the original carpet must have looked like.
The carpet in the Throne Room of the Palais des Tuileries
The medallion bearing the imperial coat of arms comes from a carpet that was initially intended for the hall of the State Council in the Palais des Tuileries. Woven at the Manufactory of the Savonnerie, after designs by a pupil of the architect Charles Percier (1764-1838), Debret, the carpet was delivered in 1810 to the throne room in the palace for the marriage ceremony of Napoleon I and Marie-Louise de Habsbourg-Lorraine. The throne room was entirely fitted out by Percier himself. The carpet was woven at the Manufactory following a large-scale model painted by Jacques Barraband (1767-1809). The central part was composed concentrically around the imperial coat of arms, which were encircled by a laurel wreath. In the central part could be found horns of plenty with the attributes of War, Justice, the Navy, and the Arts, framed by eagles with spread wings in the corners. On either side were two identical areas, the centers of which were marked with the letter N, and the background covered with foliage, crowned flowers, and lightning bolts.
Hunting down Imperial Emblems
After 1815, following the Bourbons' return to power, many objects were transformed to remove the symbols of the Empire (eagles, lightning bolts, bees). For this reason, the medallion of the cental section was separated from the carpet. The rest of the central section was sent to the château de Fontainebleau in 1857 (where it remains to this day), and a rewoven side section (given to the king of Saxony in 1809) is today in the château de Malmaison. The medallion in the Louvre presents an eagle with its wings spread, holding bolts of lightning in its talons and set against a sky-blue ground. It is surmounted by an imperial crown and encircled with the collar and cross of the Legion of Honor. All around this motif is a wide purple band separating it from the laurel wreath. This great imperial coat of arms was reproduced in all the royal palaces and on many works as a sign of imperial might.

On the baptism of his son, King of Rome, on 10 June 1811, Napoleon offered the infant's godmother - his own mother, Madame Mère - this spectacular porcelain fuseau vase. The tortoiseshell ground provides a sumptuous setting for a portrait of Napoleon crossing the Alps, after David's famous painting. The vase is typical of the designs of Alexandre Brongniart (1770-1847), director of the Sèvres Manufactory, who saw in porcelain a way of giving great history painting imperishable form.
A fuseau vase
The shape of this decorative piece, typical of the neo-classicism of Napoleon's reign, is derived from that of the ancient amphora, to which a foot has been added. The vase, which rests on a base of gilt bronze, consists of three separate parts - neck, body, and foot - and is held together by a threaded rod fixed on the inside between the neck and body. Fitments of gilt bronze between neck and body, and between body and foot, help join the parts together. A crown of laurel leaves around the bottom of the body completes the structural support. At the shoulder, two gilt-bronze handles rise from female masks, terminating in rosettes at the lip.
To the glory of the emperor
The front of the vase is decorated with a rectangular panel reproducing the picture of Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David, painted here by Jean Georget, the most renowned of the porcelain painters employed by the Sèvres Manufactory. Alexandre Brongniart, its director since 1800, saw in painted porcelain, much more durable than painting on canvas, a way of making great history painting imperishable. Another enthusiasm of Brongniart's was the imitation in porcelain of such costly materials as lapis lazuli, vermilion, and tortoiseshell. Tortoiseshell was chosen for the ground here, complemented by gilt ornament: the neck and foot have vertical stripes and bees, the latter being symbols of the Empire, while the lower part of the body has leaves of chestnut and laurel. On the reverse, also painted in gold, is an antique altar with an eagle in a laurel wreath, together with arms, a reference to Napoleon's battles.
Gifts for a godmother
The christening of his son gave the Emperor the opportunity to offer a great many gifts of Sèvres porcelain. This exceptional fuseau vase, whose decoration was painted Claude-Charles Gérard, head painter at the Manufactory, was one of a series of presents offered to Madame Mère, which included a large bust of the emperor, a cup with the portrait of the empress Marie-Louise, a vase 130 cm in height, and two smaller vases decorated with scenes of rejoicing at the peace of 1809.

33,Napoleon (1769-1821),"Bonaparte Visiting the Victims of the Plague at Jaffa, March 11, 1799",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/napoleon-bonaparte-visiting-plague-stricken-jaffa?selection=44904,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-bonaparte-visitant-les-pestiferes.jpg?1527830633,"
The painter Antoine-Jean Gros depicts the courage of General Bonaparte visiting plague-stricken soldiers in Jaffa, Syria, in 1799. Napoleon is touching one of the plague victims, as Christ did a leper. This huge canvas, hugely acclaimed at the 1804 Salon, was the first masterpiece of Napoleonic painting. Although the heroic nudes recall the work of Gros's master David, the warm colors, chiaroscuro, and oriental decor foreshadow Romantic painting. 
The courage of the general-in-chief
The picture depicts General Bonaparte visiting plague-stricken French troops in the courtyard of a Jaffa mosque being used as a military hospital. The scene took place in March 1799 during the Syrian campaign. Bonaparte, in a shaft of daylight - ignoring the doctor trying to dissuade him - touches a sore on one of the plague victims with his bare hand. One of the officers watching has a handkerchief over his mouth. On the left, two Arabs are handing out bread to the sick. On the right, a blind soldier is trying to approach the general-in-chief. In the foreground, in the shadows, the dying men are too weak to turn towards their leader. The painter is implying that Bonaparte's virtue and courage justify the horrors of war. Gros has given him the luminous aura and gestures of Christ healing the lepers in religious paintings. 
The first masterpiece of Napoleonic history painting
When he commissioned Gros to paint this canvas, Bonaparte, who had become First Consul, wanted it to help clear the accusations of the British press, who had alleged that he had wanted to execute the plague-stricken during his retreat to Cairo. The painting, presented at the 1804 Salon shortly before his coronation - a particularly opportune moment for Bonaparte - is the first masterpiece of Napoleonic history painting. Bonaparte and then Napoleon the emperor drew the painters of the time away from classical subjects and had them paint contemporary battles and imperial pomp instead, with himself as the heroic center of attention. Gros subsequently portrayed Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau (1808, Louvre), a work very similar to this one. The painting greatly influenced the painters of the next generation, Géricault and Delacroix, notably when the latter painted The Massacre at Chios (1824, Louvre).
On the threshold of Romanticism
The picture is neoclassical in its subject matter - the depiction of an example of virtue - and in certain formal aspects. The scene is depicted against a stage-like backdrop of arcades reminiscent of David's The Oath of the Horatii (1784, Louvre). The painter has given great importance to the center of the painting, where he has placed Bonaparte, and has also included several heroic nudes. But aspects of Gros's treatment in this work have broken with the art of his teacher David and herald Romanticism. The painter emphasizes the suffering of the plague-stricken, instilling a feeling of horror and the sublime in the viewer. The composition is divided into contrasting areas of light and shade. The light and colors are warm and recall those of the Venetian masters and Rubens. Gros, a precursor of the Orientalists, also took pains to depict oriental facial types, dress, and architecture.

34,Napoleon (1769-1821),L'Empereur Napoléon Ier se couronnant lui-même,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/napoleon-crowning-himself-emperor-pope?selection=44904,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-l-empereur-napoleon-ier-se-couronnant-lui-meme_0.jpg?1527839812,"
The crowning of Napoleon took place at Notre-Dame in Paris on 2 December 1804, and David was chosen to record four scenes, the best-known being Napoleon Crowning the Empress Josephine, now in the Louvre. In this preliminary drawing, David depicts an episode not  eventually shown: Napoleon crowning himself, with Pope Pius VII seated behind him.
An unforgettable scene
The day of the coronation, Napoleon decided to crown himself, even though it had been intended that the Pope perform the ceremony. This drawing was doubtless executed shortly afterwards, and David initially included the scene in the large commemorative canvas in the Louvre. Here the artist has not only captured a historic moment; his drawing of the Emperor is charged with all the significance of a conquering soldier, hand grasping the pommel of his sword in the gesture of someone who owes his new-found power to no-one but himself.
Un couple improbable
Napoleon had had Pope Pius VII come from Rome especially for the coronation. In his painting David had initially shown the pontiff as we see him here, but when Napoleon declared that he ""had not brought the Pope such a long way to do nothing,"" David introduced a vague gesture of blessing. In the drawing the contrast between the two is extraordinary: Napoleon gorged with power, the Pope overwhelmed and static.
A series of modifications
David's intention had long been to show Napoleon's crowning of himself, and three cartoons include this scene, with the Empress Josephine kneeling before her husband. When the canvas was all but finished, however, David - perhaps on the advice of his pupil, the painter François Gérard - decided to eliminate this image of the emperor and replace it with Napoleon's crowning of Josephine. The result was the celebrated painting now in the Louvre, a copy of which, made by the artist in Brussels some time after 1815, is at Versailles.

To crown the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the entrance to the former Palais des Tuileries, Dominique Vivant Denon (1747-1825) commissioned a statue from the sculptor François Frédéric Lemot—a gilded lead piece representing Napoleon driving the chariot of Victory drawn by the famous horses from St. Mark's basilica.
A sculptural group to top the Arc de Triomphe
The statue of Napoleon in Triumph by François Frédéric Lemot (1772-1827) once stood atop the Arc du Carrousel (ordered to be built by imperial decree of February 26, 1806). The arch, positioned in the central axis, formed a monumental entrance that cleverly linked the Louvre palace to that of the Tuileries. Vivant Denon (1747-1825), the director of the Musée Napoléon, was entrusted with the design of this monument to the glory of the Grande Armée, whose iconographic program was based on the victory of Austerlitz. His audacious plan for the top of the monument was a sculptural group in which the emperor himself would play the role of the god Mars and drive the chariot of Victory. The work was to be made of gilded lead—a material as solid as bronze, but three times less expensive. Vivant Denon commissioned the sculptor François Frédéric Lemot to create the entire piece: Napoleon, driving the chariot of Victory harnessed to the four famous horses from St. Mark’s basilica in Venice, flanked by the allegorical figures of Peace and Victory. Although all the projects proposed by Vivant Denon from 1806 to 1808 featured the figure of the Emperor as a charioteer, to general surprise when Napoleon saw his effigy at the top of the arch (on August 15, 1808), he ordered it to be removed, insisting that ""if nothing better can be found for the chariot, it should remain empty."" Contrary to the assertions in the Diary of Pierre François Léonard Fontaine (1762-1853), the sculpture was not taken down the next day but in 1812 (correspondence of August 16 and 19, 1812). Although it had been assembled in several pieces, it was fixed as a block to the arch with five iron bars. The unfortunate Lemot was given the task of dismantling the statue, which was then placed in the Orangerie.St. Mark’s horses—spoils of war—were returned to Venice in 1815. The sculptor Jean-François Bosio (1768-1845) made a new quadriga (four-horse chariot), in which the statue of Peace, placed between two Victories and inaugurated in 1828, can still be seen today.
Representation of the Emperor
This statue differs from other representations of Napoleon in that the slender proportions of the body and the idealized facial features make him look like a Roman emperor. Except for the drapery—a sort of compromise between the paludamentum (a cloak worn by Roman dignitaries) and the full-length ceremonial costume of an emperor—the sculptor adopted the official iconographic codes as they appear in the painting by François Gérard (1770-1837) showing Emperor Napoleon I in his coronation robes (in the Louvre, RF 1973-28). The drapery is decorated with the bee motif that symbolized the Empire; bees were considered to be the most ancient symbol of the kings of France, adopted by King Childeric I who founded the Merovingian dynasty in 457. Napoleon used references to the Carolingian dynasty and ancient Rome to establish his authority; the statue shows him grasping the pommel of his sheathed sword (one of the royal insignia known as the ""honors of Charlemagne,"" restored for his coronation at Notre-Dame on December 2, 1804) which suggests continuity with the Carolingian Empire, while in his right hand he holds the imperial scepter (the baton of command, sign of sovereign authority), topped by the eagle that, together with his laurel wreath crown, symbolized Victory in ancient Rome. The crown and scepter were specially created for the coronation ceremony by Napoleon’s official goldsmith, Martin-Guillaume Biennais (1764-1843). The emperor also wears the chain of the Légion d'Honneur, composed of eagles linked with rings; this was probably the first chain made by the goldsmith for the coronation ceremony. The plaque of the Légion d'Honneur has the shape of a star with five double branches; it hangs from the central medallion, composed of the Napoleonic ""N"", surrounded by a laurel wreath and topped by the imperial crown. These iconographic elements associated Napoleon with the most ancient French dynasties—avoiding any reference to the Bourbon dynasty, overthrown by the Revolution that had ultimately brought Napoleon to power

Antoine-Jean Gros is celebrating Napoleon I's compassion when he visited the battlefield of Eylau the day after the carnage that took place there in February 1807. Although complying with offical instructions, Gros depicts the scene with a degree of realism never attained in any other Napoleonic history painting. The eye is immediately drawn to the enormous corpses in the foreground. Here, Gros breaks with the neoclasssicism of his master David. 
The compassionate emperor
The picture depicts Napoleon I visiting the battlefield of Eylau in eastern Prussia on February 9, 1807, the day after the French army's bloody victory over the Prussians. The emperor, on a light-colored horse and surrounded by doctors and marshals, surveys the scene with great compassion, his arm outstretched as if blessing the wounded. A Lithuanian soldier, leaning against the surgeon Percy, has raised himself to say to him, ""Caesar, if you want me to live, then heal me. I will serve you faithfully as I did Alexander."" Another enemy soldier embraces the emperor's leg. Marshal Murat on his prancing horse at Napoleon's side seems a personification of war. In the foreground is a heap of dead soldiers half-covered in snow and one of the wounded, who was gone mad, struggling. The scene's horror is accentuated by the snowy landscape bathed in a wan light. 
War made unpopular
Gros painted this canvas during the winter of 1807-08, after winning the competition for the commission. Vivant Denon, the director of the Musée Napoléon, stipulated most of the painting's content: the moment to be depicted, the number of ""extras,"" the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format. The realism of the figures in the foreground, however, undoubtedly surpassed his recommendations. Gros exhibited the picture at the 1808 Salon. Police spies present at the Salon suspected the painting of rendering the war unpopular. However, Napoleon himself appreciated the work and at the artists' awards ceremony presented the painter with his own cross of the Légion d'honneur.
A realism unequaled in Napoleonic history painting
The canvas's composition is reminiscent of one of Gros's previous paintings, Napoleon Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken in Jaffa (1804, Louvre). But his realism has greater brutality here, and would be equaled by no other Napoleonic history painting. The cadaver-strewn foreground takes on more importance than in the Jaffa painting and fixes one's attention. The feeling of horror and the sublime instilled in the viewer is partly due to the huge size Gros gave the dead - the faces at the bottom of the picture are twice life-size. Some of the figures are cut off by the edge of the picture, as if the canvas were a fragment of a real-life scene. Gros painted the picture in broad brushstrokes and, as in The Plague-Stricken at Jaffa, broke with the teachings of his neoclassicist master David. The canvas heralds the works of the Romantic painters Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix.

The necklace and earrings were originally part of a parure which Napoleon I presented to Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria on the occasion of their wedding in 1810, and which was subsequently bequeathed by the empress to Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany. The necklace alone comprises 32 emeralds (the center emerald weighs 13.75 metric carats), 874 brilliants, and 264 rose diamonds.

	The necklace and earrings

	The complete parure which Napoleon presented to Marie-Louise on the occasion of their wedding consisted of a tiara, a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a comb.
	The necklace comprises ten alternating oval and lozenge-shaped emeralds surrounded by diamonds. These are separated by palmettes, each of which encloses a small round emerald. A pear-shaped emerald surrounded by diamonds hangs from each large emerald. The center emerald (13.75 metric carats) is eight-sided. Each earring consists of a large pear-shaped emerald, embellished with brilliants and two smaller emeralds.

	François-Regnault Nitot

	For his wedding to the Austrian Archduchess on April 2, 1810, Napoleon commissioned two splendid parures from the jeweler ""Etienne Nitot et fils"": one of emeralds and diamonds, the other of opals and diamonds. Both were to become part of the young empress's private jewelry collection, unlike two dazzling parures (of diamonds, and of pearls and diamonds) and parures of lesser value (such as the gold and mosaic one, now in the Louvre) which were presented by the same jeweler on the same occasion, but listed in the inventory of the Crown Jewels. An expert evaluation of the emerald set, which was delivered at the end of March, provided information as to the composition of this private parure.
	""Etienne Nitot et fils"" was managed at that time by François-Regnault Nitot (1779–1853), who succeeded his father Etienne after the latter's death in March 1809.

	Well-traveled jewels

	When Marie-Louise left Paris on March 29, 1814, she took all her jewelry with her; she had to return the Crown Jewels to the emissary of the Bourbons, but kept her personal jewelry items. She bequeathed the emerald parure to her cousin Leopold II of Habsburg, Grand Duke of Tuscany, whose descendants kept it until 1953, when it was sold to the jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels. The emeralds from the tiara were then sold one by one; a wealthy American collector bought the tiara and had it set with turquoises instead of emeralds before bequeathing it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1966. The comb was transformed, but the necklace and pair of earrings were fortunately preserved in their original state, and joined the Louvre's collection in 2004 thanks to the Fonds du Patrimoine, the Friends of the Louvre, and the museum's management.

Jacques Louis David was commissioned by Napoleon I to paint this huge canvas which depicts the splendor of the emperor’s Coronation while conveying its political and symbolic message. The painter himself was present at the ceremony, and once back in his studio portrayed the colorful congregation with realism, combining accuracy with artistry while also complying with the Emperor’s instructions. He thus met the challenge of producing a monumental work that would glorify the event and occupy a unique place in the history of painting.
A double coronation
Having won military prestige with his victorious campaigns in Italy and Egypt, Napoleon took power as First Consul after the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire. In May 1804 he was proclaimed Emperor, and a coronation ceremony was held on December 2 of the same year at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris to secure his imperial legitimacy and root his authority in the French monarchic and Catholic tradition. Moreover—like Charlemagne some 1000 years before—he was consecrated emperor by a pope. However, Napoleon crowned himself, facing the congregation rather than the high altar to mark his independence from the Church. Although David's initial sketch represented the Emperor in the act of crowning himself, the final painting shows him crowning the Empress—a gesture that presents a nobler, less authoritarian image, described by Napoleon himself as that of a ""French knight.""
A blend of art and history
David drew inspiration for the layout of his painting from Rubens's Coronation of Marie de Medici (in the Louvre). He witnessed the ceremony first-hand and had most of its participants pose for him, also reconstructing the scene in his purpose-built studio with cardboard models and wax figurines. He highlighted the protagonists by placing them in the center and illuminating them with a beam of light. The arcade provides an imposing frame for the imperial couple, also set off by the surrounding colorful congregation. The Pope sits to the right among cardinals and bishops. The great dignitaries of the Empire are shown in three-quarter back view in the right foreground, bearing symbols of imperial power: the eagle-topped scepter, the globe, and the hand of Justice. The Emperor's two brothers and two sisters are represented on the left, while Napoleon's mother looks down on the scene from her vantage point in the VIP gallery. All eyes are turned toward the crown, which the painter highlighted against a section of green curtain that overlaps the pilaster. The profile of the kneeling Joséphine—made to look younger for the occasion—stands out against the lovely yellow ocher of the cross-bearer’s cope, just in front of Marshal Murat, who is portrayed holding the coronation cushion. David used an exceptionally rich palette of colors to depict the velvets, furs, satins, and lamés of the costumes and furnishings.
""One walks in this picture""
This painting—which is also a group portrait of the imperial family, the court, and the clergy dressed in ceremonial costume—is totally realistic in appearance. Yet David took certain liberties with history and protocol: he downsized the structure of Notre-Dame Cathedral to give the figures greater impact; on Napoleon’s orders, he included Letizia Bonaparte (“Madame Mère”) in his painting, although she had not attended the coronation ceremony, of which she disapproved; again on the Emperor’s instructions, he portrayed the Pope making a gesture of blessing, having originally represented him with his hands on his knees; and the Emperor’s sisters stand immobile, though they held the Empress's train at the ceremony itself. These various artistic solutions, designed to suit this monumental painting and its fascinating hero, fully satisfied the Emperor: ""What relief, what truthfulness! This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" David realized the significance of this work for the future and for his personal fame, saying ""I shall slide into posterity in the shadow of my hero.""

The widow of General de Beauharnais, Martinique-born Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie, married Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796. Unable to provide the emperor with children, she was repudiated in 1809. Here Prud'hon shows her in the grounds of La Malmaison, a year after Napoleon's coronation. This dreamlike image is among the finest French examples of the open-air portrait at which the English painters of the time excelled. 
The painter and the emperor's family
Prud'hon was the imperial family's favorite painter and the empress's drawing teacher. In this work, the principles of the neoclassical portrait are transformed and the use of a landscape setting, in the English manner, is the source of a romantically melancholy atmosphere. 
Dreamily melancholic
On the verge of being repudiated, the empress Josephine makes no attempt to charm the viewer, whom she ignores, lost in thought on an outdoor seat. Her melancholic pose and the poetic woodland setting look forward to the Romantic passions of a Chateaubriand.  
Napoleon III's art collection
This work was part of Napoleon III's collection and his private property. After his fall from power in 1871, it was assigned to the Louvre by a court decision of 1879.

The empress Josephine only owned this cabinet, which served as a jewelry case, for a short period of time. It was delivered to her in 1809, just before her divorce from Napoleon, and subsequently belonged to the empress Marie-Louise, the emperor's second wife. The cabinet is made of yew and purpleheart, with inlaid mother of pearl and gilt bronze. Three doors open onto the main body of the piece, which holds the drawers where the jewelry was kept.

Furniture for Josephine
This jewelry cabinet was intended for the bedchamber of the empress Joséphine (1763–1814) in the Palais des Tuileries. The bronzes conceal locks and mechanisms allowing access to the drawers and secret compartments. The secret mechanisms were changed when the cabinet was given to the empress Marie-Louise (1791–1847) in 1810. In 1812, the jewelry case was supplemented by two further pieces from the cabinetmaker François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter, which were smaller but in the same style.
A cabinet of architectural shape
Designed after a model by the architect Charles Percier (1764–1838), the cabinet has the shape of a building standing on eight vertical legs and suppported by a rectangular base. Above the cornice rises a stylobate. A cassolette for perfumes stands on the base. The legs and cornice are made of purpleheart, while the interior of the cabinet, furnished with thirty drawers of the same wood (ten in each part of the body), are neither of purpleheart nor yew, but solid mahogany.
Lavish gilt bronze decoration
The jewelry case is lavishly decorated with elements in bronze. In the center is a scene depicting the birth of the Queen of the Earth, ""to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten to bear their offerings."" Long attributed to Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843), the bronzes were probably made by the Maison Jacob-Desmalter. The model for the subject in the center was the work of the sculptor Antoine-Denis Chaudet (1763–1810), whose drawings are in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Louvre. Lastly, on each of the side doors stands a goddess turning toward the central scene. The decoration as a whole foreshadows the ornamental excess of the late nineteenth century.

Pierre Séguier, Chancellor of France, was Le Brun's principal patron during his youth, notably enabling him to spend time in Italy. 
The turbulent history of a masterpiece
The portrait of Chancellor Séguier is one of those art icons we naturally think of as rightfully being in a museum. Nonetheless it was only after a long and eventful career that it joined France's national treasures in 1942. Inexplicably ignored by Charles Le Brun's contemporaries - apart from a brief allusion by the artist's biographer Nivelon - the picture is first mentioned as belonging to the Duke d'Estissac, a descendent of the Chancellor. At the time of the French Revolution it was confiscated from the Château d'Estissac along with the rest of the duke's property and taken to nearby Troyes, where it was hung in City Hall. Under the First Empire it was reclaimed by the family, who kept it in hiding until it was acquired in 1942, after the death of the Baroness de la Chevrelière, née Séguier.   
Portrait of a great patron
Pierre Séguier (1588-1672), Chancellor of France and the nation's number two administrator, was one of the great patrons, collectors and scholars of his time. Living in the sumptuous mansion built by Louis Le Vau on the Île Saint-Louis and decorated by Simon Vouet, he became the young Le Brun's leading patron, sending him to Rome and helping him cut free of the Vouet workshop. In this portrait painted several years after his return from Italy, Le Brun shows the Chancellor on horseback with eight pages surrounding him: a theatrical presentation whose measured harmony and interplay of posture are reminiscent of the ballet. What this monumental equestrian portrait offers is neither a warrior nor a conquering hero, but the pomp and grandeur of an enlightened man of state. Its origin remains a mystery: it may have been one of the official portraits intended for the walls of the chancellery, but could equally have been a private commission - which would explain why it was kept in the Séguier family down the years.   
Charles Le Brun
Le Brun remained a leading artistic figure throughout the second half of the 17th century. He supervised most of the royal projects, producing the drawings for their paintings, sculpture and ornamentation. Here he demonstrates the full measure of his talent and skill, for in addition to his large historical pieces he was a most accomplished portraitist and a master of presentation. The Louvre is also home to his portraits of Charles-Alphonse Dufresnoy and Louis Testelin.

Taken from the pedestal of the statue in the Place des Victoires, these captives represent the nations defeated by the Treaty of Nijmegen (1679). Each expresses a different reaction to captivity: revolt, hope, resignation, or grief. They were first kept in the Invalides (1804-1939) then allocated to the Louvre in 1960 and placed in the grounds of the Château de Sceaux from 1961 to 1992.
To the glory of the king
The Captives surrounded the pedestal of the statue of Louis XIV on foot in the Place des Victoires. They are by Martin Desjardins, the gallicized name of an eminent Dutch sculptor active during the reign of Louis XIV, who had already made his name with the decoration of the Hôtel Salé (now the Musée Picasso). The monument was commissioned in 1679 by François d'Aubusson, duke of La Feuillade and marshal of France, who had distinguished himself in the campaigns in Franche-Comté and Sicily. He was an astute courtier, and thought it opportune to raise a grandiose monument to the glory of his king. As a setting for the statue, he persuaded the city to open up an immense square and he had the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart design it. The square was named Place des Victoires in homage to France's victories in the Dutch War, which ended in 1679 with the Treaty of Nijmegen. The monument was inaugurated in 1686.
Four defeated nations
The captives, four larger-than-life bronze figures, symbolize the four nations defeated at the time of the Treaty of Nijmegen. Each represents one of the ages of man and a different attitude to captivity. Spain is a smooth-faced young man with streaming hair. His naked, upright body and heavenward gaze all indicate hope. The Holy Roman Empire is a bearded old man dressed in an ancient tunic. His head is bowed and his body sags in dejected resignation. Holland is young man with virile features and a short beard. His naked body poised to leap, his shoulder thrust forward in a defiant gesture and his wild expression speak of rebellion. Brandenburg is a mature man dressed like an ancient barbarian (like the Farnese Prisoners, classical marbles highly appreciated by many artists). The hand clutching his cloak, the drooping right shoulder and contorted face express grief. The Captives are all turned to the right, which encourages viewers to walk around the monument in a clockwise direction. Desjardins brilliantly varied his figures, alternating old and young, nude and clothed, upright and stooping figures, and arranging their arms and legs in different positions.
A theme from Roman art
Captives were a favorite theme in Roman art. The trophies that La Feuillade had added to the statue in 1685 - helmets, shields, insignia, fasces, halberds, oars - strengthen the analogy with ancient triumphs. But there is a prestigious antecedent in France, The Four Captives (Louvre) executed by Pierre Franquville to flank the pedestal of the equestrian statue of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf.The contemptuous iconography of the monument became inappropriate as alliances were formed and it ran counter to the spirit of the Enlightenment. During the Revolution, the gilt bronze statue of the king was melted down, but the Captives, seen as victims of absolute power, were spared and the chains that shackled them were broken. Taken to the Louvre in 1790, they were subsequently placed in the Invalides (1804-1962) then in the Parc de Sceaux, before returning to the Louvre in 1992.

The statue belongs to a series of great men, commissioned by the royal administration under Louis XVI to commemorate national glories. Julien produced a very natural-looking portrait of the great fable writer of Louis XIV's reign. At the poet's side, one of his characters, the fox, symbolizes his work. The bas-relief around the base illustrates his most famous fables.
The Great Men series
Count d'Angiviller, Director of the King's Buildings, decided in 1776 to commission sculptors at the Académie to produce a series of marble statues perpetuating the memory of French paragons of virtue and talent. The commemoration of great men, a major theme in Roman statuary, sat well with the revived taste for antiquity. But the series' main purpose was to reinforce the idea of the nation as indissociable from the monarchy. From 1776 to 1787, there were seven successive commissions, each for four marbles. The statues were destined for the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, which would house the future Museum. Until it opened they were to be installed in the Antiquities Room (the Caryatids Room). In the early 19th century, the series was divided up between Versailles, the Institut de France, and the Louvre. Although the series consists largely of soldiers, now at Versailles, the Louvre sculptures are above all of artists and writers, such as Poussin, Pascal, and La Fontaine.
A portrait of affability and intelligence
Pierre Julien received the commission in 1781, exhibited the plaster model (Musée du Puy) at the 1783 Salon, and the marble at the 1785 Salon. The critics praised the fable writer's bonhomie, insouciance, and simplicity. Julien did not give him the rather hieratic pose that commemorative monuments often demanded. La Fontaine's pose is relaxed; he is sitting casually with his legs crossed. In his right hand, carelessly resting on a tree trunk, he is holding a quill (partly broken). His carefully and delicately sculpted hair falls in long locks. His head is expressive and modeled with finesse. His gaze, although dreamily distant, conveys his sharp intellect. His brow is furrowed in thought. His faint smile expresses mischievousness tempered with bonhomie. Julien has sought less to express the traits of the writer than his vitality and intelligence.
Timelessness and period costume
It is thought that the sculptor depicted an anecdote told to him by the Duchess of Bouillon: one morning at Versailles, she came across La Fontaine daydreaming under a tree and then again in the evening in the same state at the same spot. Julien is above all depicting the timelessness of the creative reverie. The rough ground and the tree trunk against which the writer is resting do not indicate a precise location but signify nature. On the other hand, in conformity with imposed conventions, the costume is contemporary. Julien is demonstrating his skill at this, seemingly taking pleasure in sculpting the wide, buttoned sleeves, cravat, large buttonholes, and buckled shoes.The artist includes numerous references to La Fontaine's fables, in which his animal characters criticized the vices of the court. At his side, with its paw on his collected works, is his favorite animal, the fox. On the sheet of paper he is holding, the first verses of the Fox and the Grapes; around the plinth, an infinitely delicate sculpted bas-relief illustrating nine of his famous fables.

This imposing bust is one of the few portraits presented as reception pieces for the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. Jean-Louis Lemoyne demonstrated his extraordinary skill with marble in this representation of the architect of Versailles and Les Invalides, in all his splendor at the apex of his career.
The rarity of portraits as reception pieces
This colossal bust is the reception piece for the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture that was presented on 30 June 1703 by Jean-Louis Lemoyne, father of Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne (the model was approved on 29 December 1699). The Academy rarely required portraits as admission pieces. In 1679, Antoine Coysevox, Lemoyne's master, had presented a bust as an admission piece: a portrait (in the Louvre) of Lebrun who, like Mansart, was a patron of the Academy. The only other bust presented as an admission piece during the 18th century was that of Louis XV (at the Château de Versailles) made by Etienne Gois in 1770.
The glory of Jules Hardouin-Mansart
Mansart was the architect of splendors such as Versailles, the Grand Trianon, the Château de Marly, and Les Invalides. As superintendent of the king's buildings and patron of the Academy, he was at the height of his career when Lemoyne portrayed him in all his magnificence, in a tribute to the man as a great figure rather than an architect. The bust has a lordly bearing: a powerful head, haughty expression, strong nose, and smiling but disdainful mouth. The virtuoso rendering of the tall curly wig and finely chiseled lace jabot is a veritable tour de force that accentuates the majesty of the figure. Mansart is wearing the cross of the Order of St. Michael - a consecration for an artist.
The bust
The sculptor clearly sought to rival his master Coysevox, who had made a bust of the same model in 1698 (Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Paris); but he was particularly inspired by Coysevox's bust of Louis XIV (in the Wallace Collection). Lemoyne's work met with great acclaim; it was cast in bronze the following year (at the model's expense) and exhibited at the Salon of 1704.

This portrait was commissioned as a gift for Philip V of Spain. However, it was such a success at court that it was never sent to Spain. Every detail of the work is aimed at producing the quintessential image of absolute power: the nobility of the antique setting, the crimson curtain, and the solemnity of the Sun King wearing his coronation robes embroidered with the royal fleur de lys. 
Louis XIV
Louis XIV (1638-1715), the son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, was one of France's most important monarchs. He ruled from 1643 to 1715 and was known as the Sun King. His childhood was marked by the political troubles of the Fronde, so throughout his reign he sought to maintain the unity of the kingdom at all cost, crushing any moves the aristocracy made to obtain extra power. In 1660 he married Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1661, after the death of Cardinal Mazarin, finally free of his influence, Louis XIV wielded absolute power, but was shrewd enough to surround himself with devoted and talented ministers such as Colbert, Louvois, and Vauban. The royal purse, the army, industry, and administration were all reformed and trade blossomed. Louis XIV also greatly encouraged the arts. The château of Versailles is the finest achievement of his reign.
The king's coronation robes
At the time of the portrait, Louis XIV was 63 years old. He is shown wearing his coronation robes, the royal sword at his side, and holding the royal scepter. The crown is on a stool beside him. The painting of the robes is particularly detailed and refined, if somewhat overdone, reminding the viewer of the king's greatness. Other artists from Rigaud's studio must have worked on some parts of the painting, but the king's face - painted on paper mounted on the finished canvas - was the work of Rigaud himself, who produced a lifelike yet noble portrait.
A commission for the king of Spain
Louis XIV in fact commissioned the portrait as a gift for his grandson Philip V of Spain. The painting was shown at the 1704 Salon and then became part of the Louis XIV Collection. It remained in the royal collections until after the Revolution, when in 1793 it was handed over to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.

In 1685, Louis XIV's war minister, the marquis de Louvois, adopted a group of speculators' idea of creating a new square in Paris. The square was created by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, and in its center stood a bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV by Girardon standing seven meters high (around seventeen meters with the pedestal). This square was later to become the Place Vendôme. In 1792, Girardon's sculpture was destroyed. The piece in the Louvre is the only signed reduced version of the work.
The context of the commission
This bronze work is a reduced version of the equestrian statue of Louis XIV that stood in the Place Louis-le-Grand (today's Place Vendôme).To please Louis XIV, the Duc de La Feuillade had proposed the erection of a monumental full-scale statue of the king, commissioned from the sculptor Martin Desjardins. To provide a setting for the work, he redeveloped the Place des Victoires, which celebrated the king's victories in the Dutch war ending in the peace treaty of Nijmegen (1679).This initiative was followed up in 1685 by the Marquis de Louvois, the war minister under Louis XIV, who persuaded the king to create a ""Place des Conquêtes"" on the site of the Hôtel de Vendôme. Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the architect behind the Place des Victoires and who had just designed the Château and Orangerie at Versailles, was responsible for the design of this square. To surpass the rival square in magnificence, an equestrian statue was to be erected, commissioned from an even more prestigious sculptor than Desjardins: François Girardon.
The model
Girardon worked on the model from 1685 to 1687. He depicted Louis XIV as a Roman emperor wearing a voluminous contemporary curly wig. The king sits astride his mount with neither saddle nor stirrups, the horse being shown in the passant (walking) position with right foreleg raised. Girardon drew his inspiration from the ancient statue of Marcus Aurelius at the Capitol in Rome - a major reference in the field - but made his version much larger (seven meters high, as opposed to four). The king wears the cloak of a Roman commander, but no royal emblem. Only the saddlecloth is edged with fleurs-de-lis. Louis personifies sovereign authority: with a straight back, gaze directed far ahead and disdainful expression, the king points with his index figure in an imperial gesture. The horse tramples the sword and shield of a defeated enemy. Sober, calm and monumental, this effigy of the king is imposing in its classical majesty worthy of Antiquity.
The casting of the statue and its history
Transposing the statue into bronze was almost impossible to achieve. France did not possess the mastery of large bronze equestrian statues found in Italy since the Renaissance. The statue of Henri IV of France on the Pont-Neuf, the first equestrian statue erected in Paris, was made in Florence. The representation of Louis XIII on the Place Royale was an assemblage of a horse cast for Henri II and an effigy of the king that was too large for the mount.The lost-wax cast was not made until December 1692 by Balthazar Keller, a Swiss caster living in France. The single cast of a statue of this size was a technical feat, requiring the metal to be fed into every recess of the gigantic, complex mold. The cast, which swallowed up eighty thousand pounds of bronze, was a total success and unanimously admired.The statue was not set on its pedestal until 1699, on the square that was eventually named Louis-le-Grand. Considered a symbol of absolutism, it was pulled down in August 1792 during the Revolution. Several reduced versions of the work were made, some of them on the initiative of Girardon. The Louvre statue, perfectly chiseled and standing over a meter high, is the only signed copy.

Desjardins's proud, vivacious portrait of the painter Pierre Mignard is a striking testimony to the friendship between sculptor and model. The long hair and open shirt are characteristic of the disheveled look associated with artistic creativity.
Portrayed as an artist, in a token of friendship
Pierre Mignard was a major figure in French 17th-century painting. He was head of the Academy of Saint Luke, in opposition to his rival Charles Lebrun, director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture (to whom Mignard succeeded in 1690). Martin Desjardins's sculpted portrait is one of impressive presence and authority, in which the model's haughty character is expressed by the thin face turned to the left, the jutting chin and proud expression, the determined eyebrows, strong nose, and disdainful pout. His cloak is draped diagonally across his breast. The sculptor mingled psychological observation with a certain idealization, erasing any imperfection or particularity of feature, but this is a dashing portrait which represents the painter with the disheveled appearance characteristic of an artist: open shirt accentuated by finely worked lace, and long wavy hair. This bust, animated by a play of light and shade, is a precious testimony to the friendship between sculptor and model. Desjardins and Mignard collaborated on the bronze medallions for the Place des Victoires (Mignard drew the models). In Desjardins's posthumous inventory there was a Pan and Syrinx by Mignard (a copy of it, given by the artist to his eldest son Charles, is in the Louvre). 
Known portraits of Mignard
We know of two sculpted marble portraits of Mignard in Paris. The bust in the Louvre came from the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture: it was given on 29 November 1726 by Mignard's daughter, the countess Jules de Pas de Feuquières. She had the second bust placed on the tomb for her father (commissioned from Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne) at the Jacobine church on the rue Saint-Honoré (it is now in the Saint-Roch church). This bust, long attributed to Girardon, is probably a copy of Desjardins's work, adapted somewhat to suit its purpose. The countess of Feuquières had already given the Louvre (28 September 1696) a self-portrait of Mignard in a much more solemn pose, surrounded by his major works - in reference to the portrait of Charles Lebrun by Nicolas de Largillière (in the Louvre).
The posterity of this work
Artists would appreciate this portrait. In the 18th century, Louis-Claude Vassé obviously had Desjardins's work in mind when he sculpted a bust of Mignard, which was presented at the Salon of 1757, intended (together with four other busts) to glorify the celebrities of the city of Troyes. He copied the physiognomy quite closely, modernized the clothes (but kept their disheveled look), and shortened and tamed the hair (but kept it tousled). Around 1892-95, the painter Cézanne made a sketch from the bust of Desjardins (Kunstmuseum, Basel), in which he emphasized the flowing locks.

This oval medallion depicting a bust of Louis XIV in profile is made of cast glass, a process first developed to produce mirrors. This very rare piece is the work of Bernard Perrot (1638-1709), master of the Orléans glassworks under Louis XIV. A masterpiece of French glassmaking, it celebrates, at the height of his glory, a ruler who did much to encourage the progress of the arts and crafts within his kingdom.
An Italian glassmaker in Orléans
Bernard Perrot, originally called Bernardo Perroto, was a member of one of the many families of Italian glassmakers from the region north of Genoa who, in the last quarter of the sixteenth century, had established themselves in France and introduced luxury glassware into the country. After training in his father's workshop in Italy, Perrot went to work with his uncle, Jean Castellan, in Nevers. In 1662, he set up a glassworks in Orléans, whose location on the Loire attracted a number of Italian glassmakers. Perrot's workshop, which continued to make glass in the ""façon de Venise"", was granted a monopoly in the Loire region for thirty years, a privilege extended to cover the whole of France in 1672.
Cast glass: a new method of production
Perrot's great invention, which won him his monopoly, was the casting of glass on an iron plate to produce flat, rectangular pieces. This was a radically modern process which made traditional glass-blowing obsolete and greatly facilitated the production of mirrors. It also underlay the success of the great Saint-Gobain glass company (established in the town of that name in 1695), whose directors took over Perrot's invention when he lost his monopoly.
A portrait in glass
The cast-glass process also made it possible to produce portraits somewhat in the manner of antique cameos. A thick layer of molten glass was poured over a modeled relief, probably of plaster. After cooling, the surface of the resulting depression in the glass was covered with a thick coat of a preparation imitating bronze. The work was viewed from the flat side, giving the impression of solid relief. The portrait of Louis XIV was made using this process. It is oval in form and shows the king in profile, in the manner of a medal. A number of portraits of this kind are known: one is in the Musée Historique de l'Orléanais (Orléans); another is the property of the Saint-Gobain company; and a third turned up at an auction in 1976.

From the inception of the Manufacture des Gobelins, Charles Le Brun, its first director, had the idea of designing a tapestry with a historical subject to promote the glory of Louis XIV. It was to recount the glorious events that occurred in the early years of his reign both at court and on the battlefield. The panel shown here belongs to The Life of Louis XIV, which is now considered precious documentation of grand interiors and artworks that no longer exist.

	An audience at the court of Louis XIV

	In the king's bedchamber in Fontainebleau, Louis XIV sits in his armchair listening to Cardinal Chigi read the letter of apology sent by his uncle, Pope Alexander VII. Both the king and the cardinal are in the private part of the room, separated by the balustrade, while the attendants remain in the public area.
	To render the scene legible, Le Brun reduced the number of figures. Several have been identified, such as ""Monsieur,"" the king's brother, standing in front of the balustrade on the right, and the Duke d'Harcourt, the ""Grand Écuyer,"" who as a foreign prince was entitled to appear here wearing his hat. Ecclesiastics in the cardinal's retinue and courtiers make up the rest of the figures.
	The border of the tapestry is lavish, both in the materials employed and in its ornamentation, inspired by the grotesques of Raphael. A cartouche in the lower border describes the scene.

	The king's honor triumphs

	At the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV, his minister Colbert made it a policy to promote the glory of the king through the arts. As First Painter to the King, Le Brun was entrusted with orchestrating this campaign. Appointed director of the newly founded Manufacture des Gobelins, he had the idea with Colbert of employing a theme hitherto rarely developed in tapestry: contemporary history. The series of tapestries The Life of Louis XIV was originally composed of fourteen panels relating the reign's most glorious episodes: military conquests, on the one hand, and non-military and diplomatic events, on the other.
	This panel recounts the conclusion of a diplomatic incident of 1661, in which a page of the Duke de Créqui, the French ambassador to Rome, was assassinated by one of the Pope's Corsican guards.
	In compliance with the Treaty of Pisa, the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Flavio Chigi, had to come and publically present the apologies of the Holy See to the king. The audience took place on July 29,1664 in the presence of the princes and the grand officers of the crown.

	An important document of French court interiors

	The Life of Louis XIV is a major work, not only because of the number and dimensions of its panels, but also because of its outstanding workmanship and historical significance. Widely celebrated throughout Europe, it inspired the Manufacture de Beauvais to produce the tapestry of The Conquest of Louis XIV, and later the tapestry of The Victories of Charles XI for the King of Sweden.
	A key document for art history, the tapestry in particular presents interiors no longer extant, such as the king's bedchamber in Fontainebleau depicted on this panel. Except for the paintings, almost all of the room's furnishings have been identified. Quite faithfully reproduced here are major pieces from the Crown Collection: the large cabinet, the bed ""à la française,"" the alcove wallcovering, the balustrade, the large pedestal table, and the two very large silver sconces.

Coysevox, the great portraitist under Louis XIV, creates a very lifelike image of this ambivalent figure, victor at the Battle of Rocroi. The bust was executed in 1688, two years after the death of the Grand Condé. Without masking his ugliness, the artist has managed to convey the fierce, authoritarian nobility of this man, whose eagle-like profile is crowned with a leonine mane. This bust was made for the mansion of the model's nephew, the Prince de Conti, in Paris.
The Grand Condé
Prince of royal blood and cousin to the king, at the age of twenty-two Condé was victorious at the Battle of Rocroi (Ardennes, 1643), which prevented France from being invaded by the Spanish armies in the north. Taking the side of the Fronde, which on occasions served the enemy, Condé was a proud, imperious man whose personal gain came before the general interest. Despite being of a violent disposition and a libertine, he was also a cultured man, who counted among his friends the theologian Bossuet, the playwright Molière, the moralist La Bruyère, and the landscape architect Le Nôtre.
The commission
Antoine Coysevox, the great portraitist under Louis XIV, executed this bronze bust in 1688, two years after the death of the Grand Condé. The commission came from the Prince de Conti, the model's nephew, and cost the handsome sum of 1,600 livres. Although the portrait is retrospective, it draws on a terra-cotta bust (Chantilly, Musée Condé) that was probably executed by the sculptor during Condé's lifetime.
The portrait
Coysevox creates a powerful and lifelike image of Condé, conveying both the physical ugliness and nobility of the figure. A fierce energy emanates from the thin face, with its scornful lips and domineering look, framed by naturally long, wavy hair like a lion's mane. The tension in the face, with its eagle-like profile and hooked nose, makes the veins stand out in the temples. The coat is trimmed with fleurs-de-lis - the royal emblem - indicating the model's rank as a prince of royal blood. Condé is heroized by Roman-style armor, whose elements emphasize the courage, power, and pride of the great military leader: a shoulder piece with a lion's muzzle, and on the chest a griffin (a mythical creature half-eagle, half-lion). Perfect technique and a fine patina further enhance this magnificent portrait.

Alexander, standing in a chariot drawn by two elephants, makes his triumphant entry into Babylon; in the background, one can make out the terraces of hanging gardens.
A grand subject, a lofty style
Charles Le Brun had chosen a grand subject and needed to find a style with the appropriate blend of gravity and solemnity. It was also necessary to maintain the legibility crucial to a work with so many figures, while conveying the diversity of the temples, vases, weapons, musical instruments, and costumes that make the scene immediately recognizable. Lastly, he needed to give the illusion not only of a moving procession, but also of a realistic city spreading out.
Alexander and the gardens of Babylon
Alexander, who had defeated Darius III of Persia at the Battle of Issus (333 BC), foresaw another battle to take Babylon; he was surprised to see the gates of the city open to give him a hero's welcome. Le Brun depicts the moment where Alexander, holding a scepter topped by Victory in his left hand, advances in a chariot drawn by two elephants captured from Darius' army. The hero, crowned with laurel leaves, is preceded by Persian trumpeters. Next to him three men directed by a mounted warrior (perhaps Hephaestion, Alexander's friend) carry a large golden vase. In the background one can see the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; in the foreground to the left, a statue of Semiramis.
A celebration of Louis XIV
The four works were exhibited at the Salon of 1673, where they were admired for their great size and lively composition. An allusion to the grandeur of the reign of Louis XIV - who was also a great conqueror and powerful monarch - is evident, the political position clearly stated. The four works, later reproduced as tapestries, were part of the collections of Louis XIV. From the Royal Collections, the works entered the Muséum Central des Arts, which would later become the Louvre.

The elegant decoration and contrasting colors of the silver, copper, and niello inlays make this bronze bowl an exceptionally ornate piece. It was created in the Lower Empire, and commemorates the founding of Caesarea Palaestinae. However, constrained by the political context, the artist has chosen to celebrate the ancient city established by the Phoenician Straton I (374-362 BC), rather than the considerably expanded city renamed Caesarea by the Jewish king Herod the Great (first century BC).
A masterpiece
This bronze bowl, discovered in Beirut, Lebanon, is an exceptionally ornate piece in many ways. Its form - a cylindrical bowl whose bottom, instead of being flat, is a segment of a sphere with a ring-shaped foot - is fairly rare. Furthermore, the elegance of the decoration, the care with which it has been executed, the incised details, and the concern with obtaining color contrasts through the inlays are signs of a virtuoso artist. The effect originally sought by the artist was one of sparkling colors - the whiteness of the silver, the red of the copper, and the black of the copper alloy contrasting sharply with the golden color of the bronze. The object was probably an official commission, and can be approximately dated to the fourth century AD using stylistic and technical criteria. The figurative scenes, inspired by formulas frequently found in the Lower Roman Empire, are not particularly original. However, their juxtaposition takes on a particular meaning, since they are illustrating a historical event: the foundation of Caesarea on the Palestinian coast.
The foundation of Caesarea Palaestinae
The incised names of the figures do not leave any doubt as to the episode depicted. Although the city only took on real importance in the first century BC when Herod the Great, the king of the Jews (40 BC-AD 4), renamed it Caesarea and began major construction work there, the artist has depicted the establishment of the ancient city Straton's Tower, named after the Phoenician king Straton I of Sidon (374-362 BC). Straton introduced the worship of the god of Sidon, Eshmoun, whom the Greeks identified with Asclepius. Asclepius appears beside his daughter Hygieia, shaking Straton's hand. Represented on both sides is a scene of libation to Tyche, the goddess of fortune and protector of cities, and two ships landing on a shore populated with wild animals. The snake is thought to symbolize the protective power of Asclepius against the hostile beasts. Finally, a consultation with the oracle is depicted, in the sanctuary of Apollo, which predates the foundation of both cities.
A commemorative object
The decorative choice of the bronzesmith was probably dictated by the contemporary political context. The bowl commemorates the foundation of the city, and specifically the celebration of the games instituted on this occasion (the inscription engraved above Tyche evokes the ""Sacred Games""). The decoration on the object indirectly shows the religious antagonisms that affected the Roman Empire beginning in the first century AD: here, art and religion are closely serving Roman politics. Indeed, there is a political agenda behind the fact that the first founder of Caesarea (a Phoenician) has been chosen over the second (a Jew). After the suppression of the Jewish revolt of AD 66 by Titus until the end of paganism, Roman power transcribed the origins of the city in its own way, with no concern for the role of Herod and the importance of the Jewish community at the time.

The text recounts the history of the borders drawn between the Sumerian states of Lagash and Umma (Lower Mesopotamia). The archivist of Enmetena (2404-2375 BC), prince of Lagash, relates the history of the contention from its beginning at the time when Mesalim, king of Kish, ruled over all Sumeria. The people of Umma did not keep the alliance treaty. Enmetena settled the difference and rebuilt the ditch.
A precious record of the history of the Lagash Dynasty
The Sumerians created and cultivated many literary genres from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC: myths and epic tales, hymns and laments, and essays and proverbs. From time to time - especially in the epics and laments - historical facts emerge. Yet there was no historical genre in the strict sense. The documents that tell us about the events of the time are votive inscriptions on statues, stelae, cones, cylinders, vases, and tablets, which recount isolated contemporary facts and messages written to attract the favor of the gods. However, some do refer to earlier events and show a feeling for historical detail. Thus the writings of the princes of the Lagash Dynasty provide information on the events of a time when the city-states, governed by a hereditary prince and a delegate of the local supreme god, fought over border problems and strove to impose their sway over the neighboring city. The most famous example is the ""Stele of the Vultures,"" which Eanatum, Enmetena's grandfather, raised to commemorate his victory over the rival city of Umma. 
The work of a true historian
The originality of Enmetena's cone lies in the fact that the king's archivist took a historian's approach to the contention between the two cities, due to a problem over a border embankment or ditch claimed by both states, telling the story from the beginning at the time (c. 2600 BC) when Mesalim, king of Kish ruled over the whole of Sumeria. The people of Umma had ignored the alliance treaty about the ditch for three generations; it was Enmetena who settled the dispute and had the ditch (or embankment) rebuilt, pleading his case before Enlil, the great god of Sumeria, to establish his right. The text ends with curses on ""the man from Umma"" who ""would dare cross the border-embankment."" The narrative is far from objective.Excerpt from the text:""Enlil, king of all countries and father of all gods marked out the border in firm terms [...] Mesalim, the king of Kish, measured it with the surveying chain, [and] erected a stele there [...]. In vain, Enmetena, the prince of Lagash, sent messages to Ila about this embankment; Ila, the prince of Umma, who is a land thief and a vituperator, declared: ""The border-embankment ... is mine...""

54,Major Events in History,"July 28. Liberty Leading the People (July 28, 1830)",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/july-28-liberty-leading-people?selection=44900,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-le-28-juillet-la-liberte-guidant-le-peuple-28-juillet-1830.jpg?1527831264,"
The Paris uprising of July 27, 28, and 29, 1830, known as the Trois Glorieuses (""Three Glorious Days""), was initiated by the liberal republicans for violation of the Constitution by the Second Restoration government. Charles X, the last Bourbon king of France, was overthrown and replaced by Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. Delacroix, who witnessed the uprising, perceived it as a modern subject for a painting; the resulting work reflects the same romantic fervor he had applied to Massacre at Chios, a painting inspired by the Greek war of independence.
A patriotic act
Delacroix's imagination was fired by all manner of things—the natural world, a Gothic ribbed vault, a feline, a journey, a human passion... or an event that changed the course of history and reversed artistic trends. He translated his deeply felt emotions into painting, constantly renewing his style. His emotional temperament largely explains the force of his portrayal of the recent explosion of rage on the streets of Paris. 
No doubt he felt a personal involvement too, through his friendship with protagonists of the conflict such as Adolphe Thiers, who wavered between maintenance of the constitutional Monarchy and restoration of the Republic. Delacroix depended on commissions from institutions and members of the royal family, and his personal ambiguity probably confined him to the role of simple bystander (noted by Alexandre Dumas), but as a citizen-artist he helped protect the Louvre's collections from the rioters and, nostalgic for the Napoleonic Empire, was moved to see the tricolor hoisted to the top of Notre-Dame by the insurgents. 
The time had come to fulfill his own patriotic duty. He wrote to his nephew Charles Verninac: ""Three days amid gunfire and bullets, as there was fighting all around. A simple stroller like myself ran the same risk of stopping a bullet as the impromptu heroes who advanced on the enemy with pieces of iron fixed to broom handles."" 
Delacroix began his allegorical interpretation of the Parisian epic in September 1830. His painting was completed between October and December, and exhibited at the Salon in May 1831. 
As was his habit, he developed his plan for the painting using preliminary sketches for every element and at every stage. He also drew from the repertory of motifs that he had compiled on a daily basis from the beginning of his career. He thus completed the work in three months, focusing on the dramatic and visual impact of the scene: the crowd breaking through the barricades to make its final assault on the enemy camp. 
The peak of fervor occasioned by victory is represented in a pyramidal composition; the base, strewn with corpses, resembles a pedestal supporting the image of the victors. Delacroix had used a similarly rigorous composition for his painting entitled Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi, and a comparable structure is apparent in Géricault's Raft of the Medusa. Here, it serves to contain and balance the painter's vigorous brushwork, and the impetuous rhythm of the scene.
A Parisian revolution
The allegory of Liberty is personified by a young woman of the people wearing the Phrygian cap, her curls escaping onto her neck. Vibrant, fiery, rebellious, and victorious, she evokes the Revolution of 1789, the sans-culotte, and popular sovereignty. In her raised right hand is the red, white, and blue flag, a symbol of struggle that unfurls toward the light like a flame. 
Liberty wears a yellow dress reminiscent of classical drapery, held in at the waist by a belt whose ends float at her side. It has slipped below her breasts, revealing the underarm hair considered vulgar by classical artists who decreed that a goddess's skin should be smooth. The erotic realism of her nudity recalls the ancient winged victories. Her Greek profile, straight nose, generous mouth, delicate chin, and smoldering gaze are reminiscent of the woman who posed for the Women of Algiers in their Apartment. She stands noble and resolute, her body illuminated on the right, cutting a distinct figure among the men as she turns her head to spur them on to final victory. Her dark left side stands out against a plume of smoke. Her weight is on her bare left foot, visible below her dress. She may be an allegory, but this is a real battle, and she is caught up in the heat of the moment. The infantry gun with bayonet (1816 model) in her left hand gives her a contemporary look and a certain credibility. 
Two Parisian urchins have spontaneously joined the fight: the one on the left clings to the cobblestones, wide-eyed under his light infantry cap; the more famous figure to the right of Liberty is Gavroche, a symbol of youthful revolt against injustice and sacrifice for a noble cause. He sports the black velvet beret (or faluche) worn by students, as a symbol of rebellion, and carries an overlarge cartridge pouch slung across his shoulder. He advances right foot forward, brandishing cavalry pistols with one arm raised, a war cry on his lips as he exhorts the insurgents to fight. 
The fighter whose beret bears a white royalist cockade and red liberal ribbon and who carries an infantry saber (1816 model) or briquet, is recognizably a factory worker with his apron and sailor trousers. The scarf holding his pistol in place on his belly evokes the Cholet handkerchief—a rallying sign for Royalist leader Charette and the Vendeans.
The kneeling figure with the top hat of a bourgeois or fashionable urbanite may be Delacroix himself, or one of his friends. He wears loose-fitting trousers and an artisan's red flannel belt, and carries a double-barreled hunting gun. The wounded man raising himself up at the sight of Liberty wears a knotted yellowish scarf, echoing the color of the heroine's dress; his peasant's smock and red flannel belt suggest the temporary workers of Paris. The blue jacket, red belt, and white shirt echo the colors of the flag.
A modern subject
""I have undertaken a modern subject, a barricade, and although I may not have fought for my country, at least I shall have painted for her. It has restored my good spirits"" (letter of October 28 to his brother). The soldiers lying on the ground take up the foreground at the base of the pyramidal structure. In addition to the figure of Liberty, the corpse without trousers on the left, with arms outstretched and tunic turned up, is another mythical reference, derived from a classical nude model known as Hector—a personification of the Homeric hero. The Swiss guard lying on his back, to the right of the scene, has contemporary campaign uniform: a gray-blue greatcoat with a red decoration on the collar, white gaiters, low shoes, and a shako. A cuirassier with a white epaulette, lying face down next to him, is visible down to the waist. 
To the left at the back of the triangle are students (including a student of the Ecole Polytechnique with his Bonapartist cocked hat) and a detachment of grenadiers in gray greatcoats and campaign uniform. 
Although the right background of the painting contains elements of an urban landscape, it seems empty and distant in comparison with the pitched battle that fills the left side of the scene. The towers of Notre Dame represent liberty and Romanticism—as they did for Victor Hugo—and situate the action in Paris. Their position on the left bank of the Seine is inexact, and the houses between the Cathedral and the river are pure products of the painter's imagination. A sunset glow, mingled with the canon smoke, illuminates the baroque postures of the bodies and shines bright in the right background, creating an aura around Liberty, the young boy, and the tricolor flag. 
As we have already seen, the composition is given unity by the painter's particularly skilful use of color; the blue, white, and red elements have counterpoints; the white of the parallel straps across the fighters’ shoulders echoes that of the gaiters and of the shirt on the corpse to the left, while the gray tonality enhances the red of the flag. 
Delacroix was admired by Charles X, who purchased The Massacre at Chios and the Death of Charles the Bold. The artist's friends included the Duchesse de Berry and the Orléans family. He liked to attract attention in the circles of power and make his mark on public opinion, but was considered at that time as leader of the Romantic movement and was impassioned by liberty. His emotion during the Three Glorious Days was sincere, and was expressed to the glory of the ""noble, beautiful, and great"" citizens of his country. 
Delacroix's historical and political painting—a blend of document and symbol, actuality and fiction, reality and allegory—bears witness to the death throes of the Ancien Régime.This realistic and innovative work, a symbol of Liberty and the pictorial revolution, was rejected by the critics, who were used to more classical representations of reality. Having hailed the accession of Louis-Philippe, the work was hidden from public view during the king's reign, and only entered the Musée du Luxembourg in 1863 and the Louvre in 1874. It is now perceived as a universal work—a representation of romantic and revolutionary fervor, heir to the historical painting of the 18th century and forerunner of Picasso's Guernica in the 20th.

This fragment of the carved decoration of the palace of Nineveh is an illustrated account of the campaign of King Ashurbanipal against Elam, which ended with the capture and sacking of Susa. The king, on his triumphal chariot, presides over the deportation of the conquered Elamites. The realistic style and detail are characteristic of Assyrian narrative art of which the artists of the 7th century BC have left us some magnificent examples. 
Nineveh, the capital of the great Assyrian king Ashurbanipal
The reign of Ashurbanipal (669-627 BC) was the longest in the Neo-Assyrian period and was the high point of this empire, which extended over much of Western Asia. This overweening imperialism nonetheless reached its limits towards the end of his reign, when the decline began. The empire came to an end in 612 BC.It is the powerful Ashurbanipal who is depicted on this fragment from the decoration of a room in the palace at Nineveh. He is larger than his subjects who surround him; he stands in his royal chariot, a ceremonial vehicle topped with a parasol. The king holds a flower bud as part of the ritual of Assyrian court ceremonies and is wearing the truncated conical Assyrian tiara attested since the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The chariot is followed by beardless dignitaries in ceremonial robes: they are probably eunuchs from the king's entourage who were part of his personal guard or his equerries. 
The Elam campaign
The reign of Ashurbanipal was a period of conquest. Victories over Egypt are related in his annals and after a period of good relations with the neighboring country of Elam, he mounted a military campaign against his enemy until he finally captured and sacked Susa in 646 BC. The British Museum's famous Assyrian relief, known as the ""Garden Party relief,"" depicts an episode in which Ashurbanipal and his wife celebrate victory while the head of the Elamite king swings from a branch.Conquered peoples were systematically deported. In this relief we see a parade of Elamite deportees supervised by the Assyrian army. Men carrying bundles are being pushed along by soldiers. Two people are pulling a loaded cart, on which two smaller-scale veiled women are sitting. A naked child is walking between two men. Women and children seldom figure in Assyrian art. Their presence is intended to demonstrate that the entire population has been deported and to illustrate the weakness of the conquered peoples, but it gives the scene particular pathos. 
A miniaturist style for a monumental frieze
Nineveh was the site of the last period in Assyrian monumental art. Narrative art, pioneered by Sargon II in his capital Khorsabad (ao19886; ao19888-19891), reached its apogee in Nineveh. Stone orthostats became the favored medium for illustrating the royal epic. Thus the siege of Lagash or the Elam campaign are depicted in scenes often conventionally arranged in registers, in which the details of the landscape and the characters are rendered in great detail.Here, the artists have used the upper register to depict the massive deportation of the conquered people, who are marching in tightly packed lines, giving the impression of a crowd. The desire to tell the story and present accurate detail led them to show a child in the second register, probably holding his father's hand. A certain sensitivity emanates from these lines of deportees whose sufferings are rendered by the quality of the carving and the mass of details, even if their faces betray no feelings.

This painting alludes to the massacres that took place during the Wars of Religion: on April 6, 1561, the Constable of Montmorency was joined by Jacques d'Albon de Saint-André and the Duc de Guise in an anti-Protestant triumvirate. The Roman monuments, both ancient and contemporary, and the sculptures, the Apollo Belvedere and the Dioscuri, are clearly inspired by Antoine Lafréry's engravings.
Appian's history given a contemporary twist
During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the Hellenistic historian Appian wrote a 24-volume history of Rome, of which Books XIII-XVII are devoted to the Civil Wars and the massacres carried out by Mark Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus when they became triumvirs in 43 BC. Here Antoine Caron's choice of subject echoes the massacres perpetrated by Catholics and Protestants alike, with more specific reference to the slaughter of Protestants on April 6, 1561 by the ""triumvirate"" comprising the Constable of Montmorency, Jacques d'Albon de Saint-André, and the Duc de Guise. 
A Rome of the imagination
The Massacre under the Triumvirate draws its vision of ancient Rome from the engraver Lafréry's Speculum romanae magnificentia: Caron himself had not been to Italy. On the right are Emperor Commodus as Hercules, discovered in 1507; the Arch of Constantine, built in 315 AD; Michelangelo's Capitoline Square; and the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. On the left are the Apollo Belvedere; the triumphal arch of Septimus Severus, dating from 203 AD; and Trajan's Column. The centre is occupied by the Colosseum, opened by Domitian in 80 AD; and the Pantheon. In the far background stand the triumphal arch of Titus on the right, and the Castel Sant'Angelo and Ponte Sant'Angelo on the left.  
A gift from the Marquis de Jaucourt
The Massacre under the Triumvirate was given to the Louvre in 1939 by the Marquis de Jaucourt. Originally a single work, it was divided, at an unknown date, into three separate panels.

Antoine-Jean Gros is celebrating Napoleon I's compassion when he visited the battlefield of Eylau the day after the carnage that took place there in February 1807. Although complying with offical instructions, Gros depicts the scene with a degree of realism never attained in any other Napoleonic history painting. The eye is immediately drawn to the enormous corpses in the foreground. Here, Gros breaks with the neoclasssicism of his master David. 
The compassionate emperor
The picture depicts Napoleon I visiting the battlefield of Eylau in eastern Prussia on February 9, 1807, the day after the French army's bloody victory over the Prussians. The emperor, on a light-colored horse and surrounded by doctors and marshals, surveys the scene with great compassion, his arm outstretched as if blessing the wounded. A Lithuanian soldier, leaning against the surgeon Percy, has raised himself to say to him, ""Caesar, if you want me to live, then heal me. I will serve you faithfully as I did Alexander."" Another enemy soldier embraces the emperor's leg. Marshal Murat on his prancing horse at Napoleon's side seems a personification of war. In the foreground is a heap of dead soldiers half-covered in snow and one of the wounded, who was gone mad, struggling. The scene's horror is accentuated by the snowy landscape bathed in a wan light. 
War made unpopular
Gros painted this canvas during the winter of 1807-08, after winning the competition for the commission. Vivant Denon, the director of the Musée Napoléon, stipulated most of the painting's content: the moment to be depicted, the number of ""extras,"" the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format. The realism of the figures in the foreground, however, undoubtedly surpassed his recommendations. Gros exhibited the picture at the 1808 Salon. Police spies present at the Salon suspected the painting of rendering the war unpopular. However, Napoleon himself appreciated the work and at the artists' awards ceremony presented the painter with his own cross of the Légion d'honneur.
A realism unequaled in Napoleonic history painting
The canvas's composition is reminiscent of one of Gros's previous paintings, Napoleon Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken in Jaffa (1804, Louvre). But his realism has greater brutality here, and would be equaled by no other Napoleonic history painting. The cadaver-strewn foreground takes on more importance than in the Jaffa painting and fixes one's attention. The feeling of horror and the sublime instilled in the viewer is partly due to the huge size Gros gave the dead - the faces at the bottom of the picture are twice life-size. Some of the figures are cut off by the edge of the picture, as if the canvas were a fragment of a real-life scene. Gros painted the picture in broad brushstrokes and, as in The Plague-Stricken at Jaffa, broke with the teachings of his neoclassicist master David. The canvas heralds the works of the Romantic painters Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix.

This is the tenth and last panel in a series the cartoons for which had been copied by François Bonnemer from a Brussels tapestry in the Royal Furniture Repository. The latter was itself based on a large tapestry depicting Scipio's military exploits, made for François I in 1535. Eight tapestries in the present series are on display at the Louvre; the other two are in the collections of the Mobilier National.
The depiction of the battle
The scene, which is based on Livy's account of the second Punic War in his History of Rome (XXX, 33, 4-16), depicts the last battle pitting Scipio and the Roman army against the Carthaginians. Elephants in the Carthaginian army's front lines are charging the Romans, toppling men and horses. On the left, an elephant startled by the blare of a trumpet and a horn turns on its own camp. In the foreground, Scipio, wearing a starry blue mantle, leads his men, urging them to push back the enemy with swords and javelins.The border along the sides and lower edge features a broad garland of flowers, fruits, small animals, and frolicking children. The upper part consists of an architrave, probably to comply with the dimensions requested by the first patron to commission a tapestry on this theme, the Maréchal de Saint-André, whose arms grace the upper corners.
A glimpse into art history
François I owned a twenty-two-panel tapestry depicting the heroic deeds and ultimate triumph of Scipio Africanus. ""Scipio the Great"", finely woven and particularly rich in gold threads, was widely admired and copied several times. Jacques d'Albon, seigneur of Saint-André and maréchal de France since 1547, commissioned from Brussels, probably around 1558, a ten-panel history of Scipio depicting the Roman general's heroic deeds, six of which were copied directly from the king's tapestry. In the following century, it entered Mazarin's and, later, Louis XIV's collections, and, in the late seventeenth century, Louvois had it reproduced at the Gobelins, along with other Renaissance tapestries from the Royal Furniture Repository. During the Revolution, the panels were sold and dispersed. In 1797, François I's tapestry was burned along with other tapestries from the Royal Furniture Repository in order to recover the precious metals. This ""copy"" was preserved in the national collections and offers a partial but relatively accurate glimpse of the famous tapestry, since destroyed.
An innovative composition
Most of the models for the tapestry can be attributed to Giulio Romano, an artist who did a great deal of decorative painting in Italy, as well as drawings for tapestries. His colleague, Gian Francesco Penni, made preliminary cartoons for the artists who painted the full-scale cartoons. Several institutions, including the Louvre, have drawings Giulio made of the victory, as well as studies that can be related to the heroic deeds. The composition of the Battle of Zama tapestry is both original and bold. Traditionally, battle scenes had been presented in profile. Here, the artist shows the enemy bearing down on the viewer, putting him on the same plane as the Roman vanguard, thereby drawing him into the heart of the battle.

From the inception of the Manufacture des Gobelins, Charles Le Brun, its first director, had the idea of designing a tapestry with a historical subject to promote the glory of Louis XIV. It was to recount the glorious events that occurred in the early years of his reign both at court and on the battlefield. The panel shown here belongs to The Life of Louis XIV, which is now considered precious documentation of grand interiors and artworks that no longer exist.

	An audience at the court of Louis XIV

	In the king's bedchamber in Fontainebleau, Louis XIV sits in his armchair listening to Cardinal Chigi read the letter of apology sent by his uncle, Pope Alexander VII. Both the king and the cardinal are in the private part of the room, separated by the balustrade, while the attendants remain in the public area.
	To render the scene legible, Le Brun reduced the number of figures. Several have been identified, such as ""Monsieur,"" the king's brother, standing in front of the balustrade on the right, and the Duke d'Harcourt, the ""Grand Écuyer,"" who as a foreign prince was entitled to appear here wearing his hat. Ecclesiastics in the cardinal's retinue and courtiers make up the rest of the figures.
	The border of the tapestry is lavish, both in the materials employed and in its ornamentation, inspired by the grotesques of Raphael. A cartouche in the lower border describes the scene.

	The king's honor triumphs

	At the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV, his minister Colbert made it a policy to promote the glory of the king through the arts. As First Painter to the King, Le Brun was entrusted with orchestrating this campaign. Appointed director of the newly founded Manufacture des Gobelins, he had the idea with Colbert of employing a theme hitherto rarely developed in tapestry: contemporary history. The series of tapestries The Life of Louis XIV was originally composed of fourteen panels relating the reign's most glorious episodes: military conquests, on the one hand, and non-military and diplomatic events, on the other.
	This panel recounts the conclusion of a diplomatic incident of 1661, in which a page of the Duke de Créqui, the French ambassador to Rome, was assassinated by one of the Pope's Corsican guards.
	In compliance with the Treaty of Pisa, the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Flavio Chigi, had to come and publically present the apologies of the Holy See to the king. The audience took place on July 29,1664 in the presence of the princes and the grand officers of the crown.

	An important document of French court interiors

	The Life of Louis XIV is a major work, not only because of the number and dimensions of its panels, but also because of its outstanding workmanship and historical significance. Widely celebrated throughout Europe, it inspired the Manufacture de Beauvais to produce the tapestry of The Conquest of Louis XIV, and later the tapestry of The Victories of Charles XI for the King of Sweden.
	A key document for art history, the tapestry in particular presents interiors no longer extant, such as the king's bedchamber in Fontainebleau depicted on this panel. Except for the paintings, almost all of the room's furnishings have been identified. Quite faithfully reproduced here are major pieces from the Crown Collection: the large cabinet, the bed ""à la française,"" the alcove wallcovering, the balustrade, the large pedestal table, and the two very large silver sconces.

This picture depicts the key moment in the 24-picture cycle which Rubens painted for the Médicis Gallery in the Palais du Luxembourg: Marie de Médicis' accession to power. The composition has two poles of attention: on the left, ""The King being borne heavenwards,"" i.e., Henri IV's deification, and on the right, ""The Queen's Regency"". Rubens uses a complex pictorial vocabulary of allegories and mythological figures in a décor referring to antiquity to establish the regency's political legitimacy. 
The key moment in the Médicis cycle
This painting originally hung opposite the allegory to Marie de Médicis in the Triumph of Truth, the first of the 24-picture cycle glorifying the queen's greatest deeds in the Médicis Gallery in the Palais du Luxembourg. It depicts the key moment in the cycle, the establishment of the regency's political legitimacy. The composition has two poles: on the left, the deification of Henri IV after his assassination by Ravaillac and, on the right, the queen's accession to power. Their son, Louis XIII, being only nine years old, Marie de Médicis, dressed in mourning, takes the reins of power and reigns over the kingdom of the living.
A complex blend of allegory and mythology
Henri is being borne heavenwards. The writhing snake pierced by an arrow is an allusion to his assassin, Ravaillac. He is being carried away by Jupiter, king of the gods, supported by his eagle, and by Saturn, whose sickle shows that Time will remember Henri's reign. Hercules awaits him on Mount Olympus, sitting next to Mercury. Hercules was a demi-god who won his immortality through his exploits, and his image had been used by the Bourbons; Rubens is therefore playing on a flattering comparison for Henri IV, likening him to a kind of Gallic Hercules on his way to the heroes' pantheon. Marie de Médicis is surrounded by mythological figures auguring the justice of her reign. Divine Providence is handing her the helm, symbolizing a just and straight course. The queen is being advised by, on her left, Minerva, the wise warrior goddess, and on her right, Prudence, who is presenting France to her. The allegory of France, helmeted, is kneeling on one knee to offer her the globe of government, which is accepted by the gathering of the Grands du Royaume (noblemen of the highest rank) swearing allegiance to her. The reference to antiquity is manifest in this political glorification: the queen is sitting in state in front of an antique triumphal arch, Henri IV is dressed as a Roman emperor and Bellona, the winged goddess of War, is holding a trophy directly inspired by antiquity.     
Baroque inspiration to extol the queen
Tragedy and glory, two facets of a single story in which the queen is celebrated like an epic heroine of contemporary literature of the day. Two distinct episodes which Rubens subtly combines in a dynamic composition that leads the eye from curve to curve towards the right. The composition is also organically held together by color, notably by the reds echoing one another. The painting's baroque vigor was admired by many artists. The remarkable winged figure of Bellona, bursting with naked life, was copied by Cézanne many times and likewise by Delacroix, whose Liberty Guiding the People was inspired by her.

Ernest Meissonier has painted a Paris scene observed after a barricade was taken by the National Guard during the workers' riots in June 1848. This picture, devoid of pretension or pomposity, is highly original compared with a previous one also depicting a barricade: Liberty Leading the People (July 28, 1830) by Eugène Delacroix. Meissonier's painting is based on realistic observation. Known for his minutely detailed Ancien Régime genre scenes, the painter has here created his masterpiece. 
After the taking of a barricade
The corpses of rioters, together with the cobblestones that form the remains of a barricade, lie like dummies who have lost their limbs in the center of a Paris street lined with old houses. Ernest Meissonier painted this picture after a watercolor (Musée du Louvre) done at the scene on June 25, 1848, during the workers' riots. These events made for a troubled beginning to the Second Republic, a few months after the February 1848 revolution. The painter, a captain in the National Guard who was sympathetic to the government, painted the scene that lay before him after a barricade had been taken near to the town hall. The painting is highly original in comparison with another depiction of a barricade, Liberty Leading the People (July 28, 1830) by Delacroix (1831, Musée du Louvre), celebrating the revolution of 1830. There is no pretension to allegory here, no pompous rhetoric. It is the most powerful image to emerge from the events of 1848. 
A masterpiece by the ""giant among dwarves""
Meissonier wanted to exhibit this canvas at the 1849 Salon under the title of June, but he abandoned the idea because the events were too recent. He exhibited it instead under the title Memory of Civil War at the 1850-51 Salon, but the critics were put out by the painting's unpleasant subject matter. Théophile Gautier (1811-1872) was the only one who dared to admit being disturbed by it and talked of ""this trusty truth that no-one wants to tell."" Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863) had been struck by the watercolor done at the scene, upon which the painting was based. This painting is unquestionably Meissonier's masterpiece. Most of his works depict scenes of daily life under the Ancien Régime and are painted in small format. Combined with his small stature, they earned him the nickname of ""the giant among dwarves"" that was coined by Edgar Degas (1838-1917). Another of Meissonier's pictures to achieve fame was called The French Campaign, 1814 (1864, Musée d'Orsay, Paris), and became the most expensive work sold in the nineteenth century.
A scene observed
The picture is extremely realistic, Meissonier having painted every part of the canvas, the cobblestones as well as the rioters, with the same attention to detail. Unlike historical paintings generally, the work seems to portray a scene observed without comment or message. Although it depicts a historical event, it is a work that is more akin to genre paintings, particularly on account of its small size. It has recently been interpreted by an art historian as a warning to future rebels. Indeed, the artist's impassive reaction to the horror in front of him may well express the hostility of his own social class, the bourgeoisie, toward the underprivileged.

In the foreground, Henry IV, king of France, is seen fighting energetically at the Battle of Ivry. Clad in antique-style armor, he sports a tall crest on his helmet, the famous white panache to which he rallied his troops and won the battle. In the background, the surrender of the city of Mantes is depicted. The bas-relief once adorned the huge chimneypiece commissioned by the king from Matthieu Jacquet for the so-called ""Belle Cheminée"" (beautiful chimney) at Fontainebleau.
A most handsome chimneypiece
In 1597 Henry IV awarded Mathieu Jacquet a commission for a colossal chimneypiece, six metres wide and seven metres high, to be put at the end of a wing built by Primaticcio at the Château of Fontainebleau. Universally acclaimed on its completion in 1600, it was soon dubbed the ""Belle Cheminée."" It was dismantled in 1725, when Louis XV decided to convert the gallery into a theatre, and the main elements of the sculpture were preserved. The original arrangement of the monument is known through a very precise drawing by François d'Orbay, architect to Louis XIV. The bas-relief depicting the Battle of Ivry is in the center, below the large bas-relief of Henry IV on horseback (Fontainebleau), the focal point of the composition. Stylistically, the chimneypiece is closely related to the one at the Château of Villeroy, executed a decade earlier. Henry IV, a regular guest at the home of his minister, Nicolas Neufville de Villeroy, had probably admired it.
The Battle of Ivry
In 1589, following the assassination of Henry III, the Protestant Henry of Navarre became king of France as Henry IV, but he was not recognized by the Catholics. He was compelled to fight against the League (a confederation of French Catholics), supported by King Philip II of Spain. The bas-relief commemorates Henry IV's brilliant victory at the Battle of Ivry (near Chartres) on 4 March 1590, over the troops led by the Duke of Mayenne, who wanted to prevent Henry from reaching the capital. Despite his military victories, Henry IV did not enter Paris until 1594, when he converted to Catholicism.
The design of the bas-relief
Jacquet's imagery is in line with battle scenes inspired by the Italian Renaissance. This composition resembles works by Pierre Bontemps, such as the Tomb of Francis I, at Saint-Denis, where the impression of large numbers of people is suggested by the repetition of lined-up figures. The composition of the bas-relief recalls a drawing of the Battle of Marignan (Louvre) by Antoine Caron, painter of Massacres of the Triumvirate and The Tiburtine Sibyl. Similarities also exist between other sculptures from the ""Belle Cheminée"" and Caron's drawings. This learned artist may have provided the design for the chimneypiece, which was then brilliantly executed by Matthieu Jacquet. The presence of Jupiter in the clouds, crowning the king dressed in antique costume with a laurel wreath, initiated the conventional theme of the triumphant sovereign. Louis XIV would make abundant use of the motif.

Like two other pictures held by the National Gallery in London and the Uffizi in Florence, this one recounts an episode in the victory of the Florentines over the Sienese on June 1, 1432 at San Romano, near Lucca in Italy. Recent research indicates that the cycle was not, as was long thought, commissioned by Cosmo de' Medici, but by Lionardo Bartolini Salimbeni, who played a major part in the opening of hostilities against Siena. 
The counterattack by Micheletto da Cotignola
This painting was part of a group commemorating the battle between Florentines and Sienese in June 1432 at San Romano. Showing the counterattack by Florence's ally Micheletto da Cotignola, it presents the second episode in this historical cycle. The first panel, in the National Gallery in London, portrays the beginning of hostilities, with Niccolò da Tolentino leading the Florentine troops. The third, now in the Uffizi in Florence, shows the end of the battle and the defeat of the Sienese: Bernardino della Ciarda, leading the Sienese army, has been unhorsed.  
The quest for movement and the representation of form
In the presentation of the counterattack, the description of the sequence of events is a pretext for a detailed breakdown of movement. On the right the stationary warriors await the assault, with one of them preparing his weapon. In the center Micheletto da Cotignola, his black horse rearing, gives the signal for the attack. The army begins to move and on the left the cavalry charges the enemy, lances held low in the attacking position. In this way Uccello successfully creates the illusion of an overall impetus orchestrated by the lances and the horses' hooves. Thus he brings unity to the seething mass of horsemen, infantry, crests, and standards. For the painter this tangle seems to be an exercise in satisfying his obsession with representation of pure form according to the laws of optics. The main features are a host of foreshortenings and the presence of ""mazzochi"", Florentine hats whose different aspects the artist describes in minute detail. Unlike other painters of his time, Uccello does not use his extensive knowledge of perspective to place this scene in a clearly defined space: the battle is set against a relatively dark background further obscured by the passing of the years. Unfortunately we can no longer enjoy the full impact of the horsemen's gleaming armor, originally rendered with silver leaf that has since become tarnished. Uccello's quasi-scientific fixations fascinated 20th-century artists, beginning with the Cubists. His endless play with form for its own sake, together with his quest for movement in painting, gave rise to much commentary, in which he was often seen as the choreographer of a strange ballet for automata and carousel horses. 
Dating problems
The date of this major work by Paolo Uccello is uncertain and continues to be the subject of considerable debate. Critics now tend to agree that it was commissioned and executed not long after the death of Micheletto da Cotignola in 1435, a hypothesis that would seem to be confirmed by the style, close to that of the Monument to John Hawkwood painted by Uccello c. 1436, in the Duomo in Florence. Apparently arch-shaped when first painted, the Louvre panel was doubtless filled in at its upper corners and lower left area when, between 1479 and 1486, the three battle scenes were requisitioned by Lorenzo de' Medici for his palace in Florence. They are described in an inventory of his bedroom taken in 1492.

Jacques Louis David was commissioned by Napoleon I to paint this huge canvas which depicts the splendor of the emperor’s Coronation while conveying its political and symbolic message. The painter himself was present at the ceremony, and once back in his studio portrayed the colorful congregation with realism, combining accuracy with artistry while also complying with the Emperor’s instructions. He thus met the challenge of producing a monumental work that would glorify the event and occupy a unique place in the history of painting.
A double coronation
Having won military prestige with his victorious campaigns in Italy and Egypt, Napoleon took power as First Consul after the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire. In May 1804 he was proclaimed Emperor, and a coronation ceremony was held on December 2 of the same year at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris to secure his imperial legitimacy and root his authority in the French monarchic and Catholic tradition. Moreover—like Charlemagne some 1000 years before—he was consecrated emperor by a pope. However, Napoleon crowned himself, facing the congregation rather than the high altar to mark his independence from the Church. Although David's initial sketch represented the Emperor in the act of crowning himself, the final painting shows him crowning the Empress—a gesture that presents a nobler, less authoritarian image, described by Napoleon himself as that of a ""French knight.""
A blend of art and history
David drew inspiration for the layout of his painting from Rubens's Coronation of Marie de Medici (in the Louvre). He witnessed the ceremony first-hand and had most of its participants pose for him, also reconstructing the scene in his purpose-built studio with cardboard models and wax figurines. He highlighted the protagonists by placing them in the center and illuminating them with a beam of light. The arcade provides an imposing frame for the imperial couple, also set off by the surrounding colorful congregation. The Pope sits to the right among cardinals and bishops. The great dignitaries of the Empire are shown in three-quarter back view in the right foreground, bearing symbols of imperial power: the eagle-topped scepter, the globe, and the hand of Justice. The Emperor's two brothers and two sisters are represented on the left, while Napoleon's mother looks down on the scene from her vantage point in the VIP gallery. All eyes are turned toward the crown, which the painter highlighted against a section of green curtain that overlaps the pilaster. The profile of the kneeling Joséphine—made to look younger for the occasion—stands out against the lovely yellow ocher of the cross-bearer’s cope, just in front of Marshal Murat, who is portrayed holding the coronation cushion. David used an exceptionally rich palette of colors to depict the velvets, furs, satins, and lamés of the costumes and furnishings.
""One walks in this picture""
This painting—which is also a group portrait of the imperial family, the court, and the clergy dressed in ceremonial costume—is totally realistic in appearance. Yet David took certain liberties with history and protocol: he downsized the structure of Notre-Dame Cathedral to give the figures greater impact; on Napoleon’s orders, he included Letizia Bonaparte (“Madame Mère”) in his painting, although she had not attended the coronation ceremony, of which she disapproved; again on the Emperor’s instructions, he portrayed the Pope making a gesture of blessing, having originally represented him with his hands on his knees; and the Emperor’s sisters stand immobile, though they held the Empress's train at the ceremony itself. These various artistic solutions, designed to suit this monumental painting and its fascinating hero, fully satisfied the Emperor: ""What relief, what truthfulness! This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" David realized the significance of this work for the future and for his personal fame, saying ""I shall slide into posterity in the shadow of my hero.""

After the abduction of the Sabine women by the neighboring Romans, the Sabines attempted to get them back - David depicts this episode here. The Sabine women are intervening to stop the bloodshed. Hersilia is throwing herself between her husband, the king of Rome, and her father, the king of the Sabines. David is using the subject to advocate the reconciliation of the French people after the Revolution. His increasingly simple style is inspired by Ancient Greece.  
Heroines
David's painting depicts a legendary episode from Rome's beginnings in the 8th century BC. After the Sabine women had been abducted by the neighboring Romans (the scene Poussin depicted in his masterpiece The Rape of the Sabine Women, Louvre), the Sabines attempted to get them back. David shows the Sabine women intervening to stop the battle raging beneath the ramparts of the Capitol in Rome. The painting is a masterful summary of the whole episode. Hersilia is leaping between her father Tatius, the king of the Sabines, on the left, and her husband Romulus, the king of Rome, on the right. A woman is pointing at her children; another has thrown herself at a warrior's feet. The picture also evokes the happy consequences of their intervention. The horseman on the right is putting his sword back into its sheath while, further away, hands and helmets are raised in gestures of peace. Unlike in David's previous paintings (The Oath of the Horatii, Brutus, Louvre), women play the crucial role here.
A topical painting
David was a member of the Convention and a faithful partisan of Robespierre. In 1794, after Robespierre's downfall, he was imprisoned. It was during his incarceration that he began thinking about painting this subject, which would demonstrate that he was a man of peace and thus in tune with the spirit of the age. The canvas, eagerly awaited by the Paris art world, was finished five years later in 1799. David was extremely proud of the painting, which he considered his finest. Instead of showing it at the Salon, he presented it at an independent, paying exhibition in his studio in the Louvre - a type of event destined for a brilliant future. He wrote a text for the occasion, justifying this form of exhibition and the controversial nudity of the warriors.  
""Pure Greekness""
While he was preparing this painting, whose subject is Roman, David proclaimed, ""I want to paint pure Greekness."" He wanted to mark his transition from the severe, Roman style of The Oath of the Horatii (Louvre) with a new pictorial manifesto. He also wanted to measure himself against the great artists of Ancient Greece. He adhered to the theories of the German archaeologist and historian of ancient art Johann Winckelmann on idealized beauty. In his painting, he depicted his warriors fighting naked, as in Greek sculpture, and opted for a frieze-like composition of minimal spatial depth. The effect is reinforced by the predominance of drawing over color, the uniform light, and a simplified color scheme. The new direction David's art had taken was a response to the ideas of some of his pupils, the ""Primitives."" Close to Ingres, they criticized their master's Roman inspiration and advocated an archaic style.

In the twelfth century, while celebrating Mass, Saint John of Matha had a vision of an angel, with arms intersecting, resting its hands on the heads of two captives. Following this vision he founded the Order of the Most Holy Trinity, known as the Order of the Trinitarians, dedicated to freeing Christian slaves from captivity under the Muslims. This monumental canvas, commissioned for one of the order's convents in Pamplona, is a masterpiece of the baroque style in its compositional flow. 

	A vision
When celebrating his first Mass, at the moment of elevating the Host, Saint John of Matha had a vision of an angel with arms intersecting and hands placed on the heads of two kneeling slaves. The young priest's mission was revealed to him: it was to found an order dedicated to freeing Christian slaves held captive by the Muslims. The congregation founded in 1198 was called the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and its members were known as Trinitarians, or Mathurins in France. On this canvas, the faces of the numerous participants in the Mass, including many monks and nuns, all show deep devotion as they turn to face the Host. In the background, the church opens onto a terrace where a meeting is taking place between John of Matha and the hermit Felix of Valois. The latter is approving the young priest's decision to found an order. The two saints also had a vision of a white stag with a cross between its antlers, which can be glimpsed in the landscape that forms the background. The painter has set these events in the Spain of his own time, as is indicated by the baroque architecture of the church and the clothes of the aristocrat in the foreground. Next to the angel, in the upper part of the canvas, can be seen the Trinity with the dove of the Holy Spirit hovering above God the Father and Christ, who are seated side by side with angels playing musical instruments.

	One artist composes the picture, the other interprets
This work was commissioned in 1665 from Francisco Rizi and Juan Carreño de Miranda to adorn the high altar of the Trinitarian church at Pamplona in Navarre. They were the two most renowned Spanish artists of the time. Although Francisco Rizo probably devised the broad outlines of the composition (as is evident from one of his drawings in the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), the painting itself is entirely the work of Carreño, who was the only one to sign it. This painting marks the high point in the association between the two artists-while one composes the other interprets. Rizi and Carreño drew on the Flemish and Italian art of their time in order to bring about a renaissance in their own country, thereby bringing Spanish art more into line with that of other European countries.

	A masterpiece in the international baroque style
This large canvas, with its composition full of movement, is a masterpiece of the international baroque style. The lower part of the picture is crossed by oblique lines created by the bodies and gazes of the figures. The Host being presented by the saint forms the summit of a pyramid. The whole canvas conveys an impression of monumental space. Near to ground level there are contrasts of light and shade, warm colors, a silvery harmony as the light sparkles; while at the top of the picture, nearer to the heavens, the colors are colder and the light is transparent. Francisco Rizi's technique is very free, especially in the depiction of the gold and silver embroideries on the costumes.

In the 7th century BC, the three Horatii brothers, chosen by the Romans to defy the Curiatii, the champions of the town of Alba, are swearing to defeat their enemies or die. As they receive their weapons from their father, the women of the family are prostrate with suffering. This painting, a royal commission, was the manifesto for a new style, neoclassicism. Both the architecture of the room and the poses of the warriors are rigorously geometrical. 

	The Horatii and the Curiatii

	In the 7th century BC, to put an end to the bloody war between Rome and Alba, both cities designated champions: the former chose the Horatii, the latter the Curiatii. The two families were linked by marriage. Jacques-Louis David depicts the Horatii swearing to defeat their enemies or die for their country. On the right, the grief-stricken women of the family already fear the worst: Sabina, the sister of the Curiatii and wife of the eldest of the Horatii, and Camilla, the sister of the Horatii and betrothed to one of the Curiatii, hang their heads in sorrow, while behind them, the mother of the Horatii hugs her grandchildren.

	A new moral painting

	David chose this episode in Roman history for his first royal commission in 1784. A Prix de Rome laureate in 1774 and a member of the Académie, he wanted to launch his public career by creating a stir with a radically innovative picture. He forsook the amorous and mythological subject matter of his first teacher, Boucher, for the Roman historians and Corneille's classical play Horace (1640). David presents this episode as an example of patriotism and stoicism. In this respect, he is close to philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Diderot, who advocated the painting of moral subjects. David also wanted to give his painting an orginal form. He sought to emulate the grand style of his 17th-century forebears Poussin and Le Brun. David returned to Rome, where he could draw inspiration from ancient art for this painting. He presented the finished canvas in his studio in Rome in 1785, then at the Paris Salon later that year, on both occasions to acclaim.

	The manifesto of neoclassicism

The Oath of the Horatii is the first masterpiece of a new style breaking with the rococo style. The composition is broad and simple, with the life-size figures arranged in a frieze in the foreground, as on Roman sarcophagi and Greek vases. The figures are separated by large empty spaces in a stage-like area shown head-on. David emphasizes the room's geometry. The harsh, slanting light gives the figures their relief, and their contrasting characters are conveyed using different forms. He gives the men energetic bodies constructed out of straight lines and dresses them in vivid colors, while the women are all sinous curves and muted colors. The painting became the model throughout Europe for the new style of painting later known as neoclassicism.

The Raft of the Medusa—a major work in French 19th-century painting—is generally regarded as an icon of Romanticism. It depicts an event whose human and political aspects greatly interested Géricault: the wreck of a French frigate off the coast of Senegal in 1816, with over 150 soldiers on board. The painter researched the story in detail and made numerous sketches before deciding on his definitive composition, which illustrates the hope of rescue.
A contemporary event
Géricault drew his inspiration from the account of two survivors of the Medusa—a French Royal Navy frigate that set sail in 1816 to colonize Senegal. It was captained by an officer of the Ancien Régime who had not sailed for over twenty years and who ran the ship aground on a sandbank. Due to the shortage of lifeboats, those who were left behind had to build a raft for 150 souls—a construction that drifted away on a bloody 13-day odyssey that was to save only 10 lives. The disaster of the shipwreck was made worse by the brutality and cannibalism that ensued. 
Géricault decided to represent the vain hope of the shipwrecked sailors: the rescue boat is visible on the horizon—but sails away without seeing them. 
The whole composition is oriented toward this hope in a rightward ascent culminating in a black figure, the figurehead of the boat. The painting stands as a synthetic view of human life abandoned to its fate.
Dissecting the subject
Géricault spent a long time preparing the composition of this painting, which he intended to exhibit at the Salon of 1819. He began by amassing documentation and questioning the survivors, whom he sketched; he then worked with a model and wax figurines, studied severed cadavers in his studio, used friends as models, and hesitated between a number of subjects. The result of this long preparatory period can be seen in two sketches now in the Louvre (RF 2229, RF 1667). There followed the period of solitary work in his studio, spent getting to grips with a vast canvas measuring five meters by seven. 
The pallid bodies are given cruel emphasis by a Caravaggio-style chiaroscuro; some writhe in the elation of hope, while others are unaware of the passing ship. The latter include two figures of despair and solitude: one mourning his son, the other bewailing his own fate. These figures reflect the Romantic inspiration that fueled the work of both Géricault and Gros, and the former's admiration for the latter (see The Plague-Stricken in Jaffa).
A hint of scandal
Géricault's Raft was the star at the Salon of 1819: ""It strikes and attracts all eyes"" (Le Journal de Paris). Critics were divided: the horror and ""terribilità"" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a ""pile of corpses,"" whose realism they considered a far cry from the ""ideal beauty"" incarnated by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea (which triumphed the same year). Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin was categorical: ""Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.""
The painting had fervent admirers too, including Auguste Jal who praised its political theme, its liberal position (the advancement of the ""negro"", the critique of ultra-royalism), and its modernity. For Michelet, ""our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa [...].""

The carriage could be that of the young Prince William of Orange (William III), future Stadtholder then king of England.  
A carriage ride at low tide
An impressive carriage is making its way along the peaceful beach at Scheveningen, the team led by a man on horseback, the driver cracking his whip. One of the valets, also wearing blue livery, is running after two hunting dogs playing on the sand. The carriage could be that of the young Prince William of Orange (William III), future Stadtholder then king of England. The tide is out, villagers are walking on the beach, children are playing and a man is returning from fishing with a large net. The verticals of the masts of the beached boats and of the small church steeple give rhythm to this essentially horizontal composition.   
Precise details
Adriaen van de Velde belonged to a long dynasty of Dutch painters. He was born in Amsterdam, where he was trained by his brother Willem van de Velde the Younger, a painter of seascapes and naval battles. He then worked in the studio of the landscape painter Jan Winants in Haarlem. He kept his brother's taste for precise detail, a penchant which is accentuated by the influence of the very precise drawing of Paulus Potter. Each detail, even the most distant, is treated with great finesse. The painter uses diagonal backlighting to give the carriage relief and emphasize the whiteness of the horses.
The transparency of sea air
The painting derives much of its charm from its poetically delicate light. A stay in Italy from 1653 to 1656, but also the decisive influence of Italianate painters such as Karel Dujardin and Nicolaes Berchem, drew van de Velde's palette towards warmer hues and a softer, golden light. In the vast sky with its heaving rolling clouds, the sun seems to make the damp sea air glisten. Van de Velde's peerless talent enables him to play with the brightest simplicity and capture the limpid yet hazy transience of the sea air.

Constantin Guys became a war correspondent when he was forty and developed his talent for observation over the next twenty years. Back in Paris, he put his experience to good use, acutely describing Paris society and becoming the historiographer of his times. The public were particularly fond of his drawings of carriages, like this watercolor showing two elegant women in a barouche. The poetic treatment of their pale gowns contrasts with the austere stiffness of the valets in their black livery.
An adventurous reporter
At twenty, Constantin Guys fought alongside Lord Byron in the war of Greek independence; he enlisted in a regiment of dragoons, then tutored the grandchildren of the English watercolor artist Thomas Girtin. From 1842 to 1860, he was a war correspondent with the Illustrated London News, dispatching drawings to illustrate current events in the East and in Europe. He depicted episodes in the Crimean War and the 1848 Revolution in France through precise drawings with annotations for the engravers who would turn them into woodcuts. This experience sharpened his powers of observation, and he learned to catch the essence of a scene in a few minutes. Thus, when he settled in Paris at the age of sixty, he used the same techniques to observe and sketch people from all social classes. With a few strokes of his pen or brush, and astonishing assurance, he drew the elegant ladies of the Second Empire along with the low life of the capital.
The painter of modern life
""The Painter of Modern Life"" was the title of a important study that Baudelaire made of Constantin Guys, published in Le Figaro in 1863. The writer considered the artist to be an acute observer, whose bemused eye was riveted on society and whose drawings were ""precious records of civilized life."" He portrayed Guys as the ""historian"" of his times, documenting contemporary life and treating its everyday activities as a subject worthy of art. He scrutinized all aspects of Paris life. But, after 1860, fashionable women became the central figures in his work and eventually his only subject. He paid equal attention to society women or the idle rich, street women or prostitutes. His sensitive view of social foibles conferred on Guys's drawings a special atmosphere, also found in Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, which presents a similar vision of women and their powers of seduction.
A purely graphic oeuvre
Constantin Guys's work seems to have been restricted to drawings. In Paris he did not work from nature, but drew from memory, at home. He observed his subjects closely, then pared away all but the essential features, bringing out the singularity of a scene or character. He worked with broad planes and the play of light, and over the years tended towards simplification and unity. Some of Guys's drawings focus on equipages. This drawing of a barouche is an example of that theme; it has been swiftly rendered and heightened with watercolor to accentuate light and color. Showing an disregard of classical tradition, Guys's work is uniquely innovative in the history of drawing in the 19th century.

Chariot  scenes were one of the favorite subjects of the relief art that reached its apogee in the independent principalities that emerged in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria after the fall of the Hittite Empire in about 1200 BC. A particularly brilliant school of sculpture developed in the kingdom of Milid (Malatya), as is witnessed by this relief of a deer hunt, in which the legacy of Hittite art combines with influences from Mesopotamia and Syria.
A deer hunt
The hunting of deer is a very old theme in the iconography of the Hittite world, and is depicted as conducted from a chariot in this orthostat relief discovered at Malatya in southeastern Anatolia. Such bas-relief slabs were applied to the lower part of the walls in palaces and official buildings. While they had a decorative role, they were also functional, protecting the base of a wall constructed of unbaked brick.
The influence of Assyrian relief
Despite the fall of the Hittite Empire in about 1200 BC, in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria Hittite culture survived in a series of successor principalities. Malatya, the kingdom of Milid, was one of the most flourishing of these small Neo-Hittite kingdoms. In the 11th century BC, a school of sculpture that continued to work with the traditional forms of Hittite relief was estabished there. This deer hunt relief is, however, more recent, betraying the growing influence of the Assyrian Empire on the kingdom even before it fell under the Assyrian sway in the 8th century BC.
A war chariot
Inscribed with the name of Maradash, a king of Milid whose precise regnal dates are unknown, this relief shows two figures dressed in the local style riding on a light chariot. This type of chariot with its single axle had relatively small wheels with only six spokes. A spear or pike can be seen in the back of the chariot and two crossed quivers are fastened to the side: these details allow the relief to be dated to around the 11th century BC. Though these fast and maneuverable chariots might be used for hunting, their main role was military. In accordance with a convention later abandoned, only one horse is shown, although there were in fact a pair. As the bowman prepares to shoot his arrow, the driver has the reins firmly in hand, matching his speed to that of the fleeing deer; the hunters are accompanied by a dog. Above the horse's back can be seen the rigid pole of the chariot. The horse has no bit, and the reins seem to be fastened directly to the bridle; a belly band with two pompoms can be seen behind the shoulder, while the head would have been crowned with a plume.

Pigalle's Mercury (approved in 1741) was executed for his admission to the Academy in 1744. The sculptor presented a significantly larger plaster model of this subject at the Salon of 1742, paired with a Venus; both statues were made in marble for the king, and presented in 1750 to Frederick II of Prussia.

	A twisted position

	Mercury, the messenger of the gods, is sitting on a rock, ready to leap up. He is attaching the winged sandals which, together with his petasus (winged cap), will enable him to take flight. The god's twisted position and the play of his limbs make the composition interesting to observe from every angle. Mercury is not looking at his talaria (winged sandals) as he attaches them, but his gesture is accentuated by the convergence of both arms and one leg. His crouched position, the upward slant of his limbs and shoulder line, and his face turned to scan the horizon, give an impression of dynamism — that Mercury is about to soar into the sky. The position of his left leg, with his weight on his toes, also suggests that the messenger god is ready for take-off. This pose was perhaps inspired by the Mercury and Argus by Jacob Jordaens (a 17th-century Flemish painter), popularized by engravings. But the play of diagonals and the multiple viewpoints afforded by sculpture in the round enabled Pigalle to add a vitality that transformed the figure of the god into an allegory of speed. Mercury's torso is a variation on the Belvedere Torso (in the Vatican); this antique marble fragment of a muscular seated figure has a strength that fascinated Michelangelo — and has continued to fascinate artists and art lovers. It was left incomplete, which was unusual for the 18th century, and thus became a metaphor for Time that destroys the creations of Genius. It symbolized sculpture, as it does in Jacques Buirette's 1663 reception piece, the bas-relief entitled The Union of Painting and Sculpture (in the Louvre).

	The Academy reception piece

	When Pigalle returned to Paris in 1741 after a stay in Rome (1736–39), he presented his terracotta model of Mercury for approval by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture; according to an anecdote, he had almost left the work as a pledge of payment for his accommodation when passing through Lyon. Instead of imposing another subject, the Academy asked him to transpose the model into marble for his admission piece, and he was accepted on 30 July 1744. Mercury was originally designed as an isolated figure, but in 1742, Pigalle added a matching piece: Venus Giving a Message, which illustrates an episode from the Golden Ass, a collection of tales by Latin author Apuleius (c. 125–170). In 1746, the Royal Administration commissioned Pigalle to produce a life-size marble sculpture of each figure; these works were completed in 1748, and presented by Louis XV to King Frederick II of Prussia for the park of the Sans-Souci castle near Berlin.

	An instant and lasting success

	The work was an instant success. In The Century of Louis XIV (1751), Voltaire compared it to the finest works of Greek antiquity. Many replicas were acquired by artists, and it featured in a number of paintings: the painter Chardin, a friend of Pigalle, used it to symbolize sculpture in his works The Drawing Lesson (1747, Vanas) and The Attributes of the Arts (1766, Minneapolis). A smaller version in biscuit porcelain was produced by the Sèvres manufactory as of 1770.

73,Travel...,Model of figures in a boat,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/model-boat-figures?selection=44898,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-modele-bateau-occupe-par.jpg?1527832363,"
Representations of boats appear in Cyprus towards the end of the Early Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC). The figures and the bird that appear on this model boat in painted terra-cotta have suggested a number of different interpretations ranging from the realistic, through the cultic, to the mythical. Dating from the Middle Bronze Age, this is an example of so-called White Painted ware, in which the pottery is covered with a white slip on which the decoration is applied in brown.
A maritime scene
The boat has a bulging oval hull, the raised prow and stern being indicated by round, tapering projections. On the rim, pierced with a hole in the middle of each side, are eight half-length figures in different poses, together with a bird. One figure holds its hand to its head, another has its hands on its hips, while a couple hug each other. All have slender bodies, small pinched noses, two holes for the eyes, and an incised mouth. They wear earrings, and all except one have a conical headdress adorned with circlets. These figures are decorated with horizontal bands, while the hull has a criss-cross pattern below and alternating bands of diagonals above. Painted pottery is the distinctive feature of Middle Bronze Age Cypriot civilization. The holes in this piece were probably to allow it to be hung up.
Various possible interpretations
This boat belongs to the Cypriot tradition of terra-cotta models representing shrines, other buildings, and boats, as well as groups of figurines such as the Group of Figures at a Washing Trough or the Group with Vessels. The depiction of pottery animal and human figures in the round is also characteristic of Cyprus. For some scholars, the presence of the bird - considered an attribute of the Cypriot great goddess of fertility - and the pose of the figure with a hand held to the forehead - interpreted as a gesture of adoration - suggest a religious significance. For others, the piece may represent a mythical scene comparable to the abduction of Helen. On the other hand, it may simply represent a scene from everyday maritime life.
Testimony to Cyprus's maritime trade
These boat models appear in Cyprus towards the end of the Early Bronze Age, as for example the terra-cotta ship in the Louvre (AO 17521). This impressive iconographic series continues into the Iron Age (AM 636). The images very likely testify to the regular maritime trade associated with the great cities and the production of metal.

During late antiquity, the mosaic floors of villas began to resemble veritable carpets that rivaled each other in the magnificence of their motifs and colors. This huge fourth-century mosaic, originally completed with a vast geometric frame, adorned the reception room of a wealthy Constantine home. It represents the triumph of the sea god Neptune and his wife Amphitrite, who are shown standing in a chariot drawn by sea horses and surrounded by cupids.
The paved floor of a North African villa
This huge mosaic was unearthed during one of the first archaeological missions in Algeria, which was conducted by Major Delamare in the 1840s. It adorned the floor of a reception room in a wealthy villa in Constantine (ancient Cirta). A huge geometric carpet, which consisted of medallions inside octagons formed by laurel wreaths, originally framed the figured scene. The paved floor, which then measured 8.36 m by 7.14 m, resembled a veritable carpet whose elegance stemmed from its diversity of motifs and wealth of colors. Practically the entire mosaic floor is in the Louvre: the figured panel is on display in the Mosaic Gallery, and sixty fragments of the geometric frame are in the reserve collection.
The triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite
Although seascapes had an important place in the repertory of North African mosaicists during the Roman period, the theme represented on this particular panel was relatively rare in mosaic art. The subject is the triumph of the sea god Neptune and his wife Amphitrite, and the composition is particularly original. It was no doubt inspired by certain Dionysian images and coronation scenes, familiar from sarcophagi and mosaics from the third and fourth centuries AD. Both deities are represented standing on a chariot drawn by four sea horses. Two cupids are holding a canopy over their heads, thus enhancing the majesty of the divine couple; other putti, in front of them, are fishing in the teeming sea. Two other cupids are swimming with dolphins in front of the boats.
A work from the early fourth century AD
This mosaic was designed in a highly classicizing style. Several indications suggest that it dates to circa AD 315-25: the hairstyle of the goddess, the quality of the drawing, the symmetrical composition, and the refined palette with its sparkling colors that play on the shades obtained by the opus tessellatum technique. In accordance with other late examples, a certain horror of the void is expressed by the profusion of waves on the sea, and the abundance of fish and shells.

Pilgrim flasks, or ampullae, are small metal, glass, or terra vials such as this one, used by pilgrims in Antiquity and in the early Middle Ages, to carry home water or oil from the lamps burning in the sanctuaries visited. They also held oil that had been placed near the relics of a martyr and even earth scooped up piously from around a worshiped tomb.
The flask
This ampulla is shaped like a flattened gourd with two small handles on the side and a small spout. Its size and quality set it apart from the usual flasks, although the images are typical: Saint Menas, identified by his name written in Greek, and Saint Thecla.The two figures were not contemporaneous: Saint Paul converted Thecla to Christianity, and Menas was martyred during the reign of Diocletian (third century). They were probably placed together on these small sacred souvenirs because their Egyptian shrines were situated near each other: Menas was worshipped in the Abu Mina basilica southwest of Alexandria; and Thecla in Dekheila, in the outskirts of Alexandria, on the road to Abu Mina.Menas is always depicted in the same, strictly symmetrical pose: standing, wearing a short, long-sleeved tunic cinched at the waist by a broad belt, his shoulder covered with a military cloak and wearing laced boots. He faces forward, his arms are raised, and he is flanked by two kneeling camels.Thecla had refused to marry a high-ranking magistrate of Antioch and sentenced to face ""the beasts"" in the arena. The unfortunate animals - bulls, lions, bears, seals, and others - retreated four times when confronted with the power of God and the projectiles hurled from the stands by women spectators, who strongly supported their unfairly convicted ""sister.""The image of Thecla is a stereotypical as that of Menas's: the saint is standing, slightly off-balance, with her hands tied behind her back. She is surrounded by the animals in the arena: two bulls, a she bear, and a lioness. .
Two martyrs
These two martyred saints are emblematic of Egyptian hagiography. Menas was an Egyptian soldier martyred in Phrygia. As his body was being brought back to Egypt was the camel carrying it stopped suddenly in the desert. The escort of his followers decided to bury Menas at that spot. A miraculous spring appeared, and the site became a major pilgrimage destination. The quasi-industrial production of Saint Menas pilgrim flasks flourished in the 4th and 5th centuries: pilgrims from throughout Europe purchased and disseminated these objects. Thecla was buried in Seleucia in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey); the origins of her cult in Egypt have not been clearly determined.
The pilgrimage
Religious pilgrimages were already well established in the pagan traditions of Antiquity. Worshipers returned home from these trips with souvenirs of terracotta figurines and amulets depicting the deity visited. Early Christians adopted this custom and undertook pilgrimages to the tombs of saints and martyrs. Stories of these voyages have survived, such as Etheria's Pilgrimage, a narrative of a trip she made to the Holy Sites in Egypt and the Middle East in the fourth century. She received ""holy flasks"" from the monks who provided hospitality to the pilgrims.

Are the lovers about to set sail for Cythera, or are they returning from the island of love? The question is still open. This superb painting was the reception piece that Watteau submitted to the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. The subject was so striking and so new that the expression ""fête galante"" was invented to describe it. 
Setting out for the island of love - or leaving it?
Watteau took five years to complete this large painting, which he submitted to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture as his reception piece. The reason it took him so long was that at the same time he was also working on the increasing number of private commissions that his growing reputation brought him. Watteau was given approval to submit the painting in 1712, but only actually submitted it in 1717. The work - The Pilgrimage to Cythera - proved to be one of his masterpieces, and he was admitted to the Academy as a painter of ""fêtes galantes"" - courtly scenes in an idyllic country setting. But does the work actually depict couples setting out for the island or returning from it? Art historians have come up with a wide variety of interpretations of the allegory of the voyage to the island of love. The work remained in the collections of the Academy until it was moved to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République - later the Musée du Louvre - in 1793. The work marks an important milestone in the history of 18th century art. Such was its success that Watteau painted a second version at the request of his friend Jean de Julienne. This second version is in the Friedrich II collection in the Charlottenburg palace in Berlin.
The myth of Cythera
In Antiquity, Cythera, one of the Greek islands, was thought to have a serious claim to be the birthplace of Aphrodite, goddess of love. The island thus became sacred to Aphrodite and love. The painting may have been inspired by certain 17th century operas or possibly a comedy by Dancourt entitled The Three Cousins, first performed in 1700. Watteau's masterpiece is an allegory of courtship and falling in love. The first couple is sitting absorbed in flirtatious conversation. They are next to a second pair who are just standing up, while a third pair are heading for the ship. The young woman is looking back in nostalgia at the place where she has spent so many happy hours. In the distance, a number of figures are climbing aboard a superb ship with cherubs hovering overhead. Critics have always admired the highly rhythmical structure of the painting, the subtle sense of continuity between the groups of figures, the vibrancy of the brushstrokes, and the beautiful colors. Without doubt, the mysterious hazy landscape in the distance is one of the most innovative features of the painting, reflecting the influence of the landscapes of Rubens and Leonardo da Vinci.
Rodin's opinion of the painting
""What you first notice at the front of the picture (.) is a group composed of a young maiden and her admirer. The man is wearing a cape embroidered with a pierced heart, a gracious symbol of the voyage that he wishes to embark upon. (.) her indifference to his entreaties is perhpas feigned (.) the pilgrim's staff and the breviary of love are still lying on the ground. (.) To the left of this group is another couple. The maiden is accepting the hand of her lover, who is helping her to stand. (.) A little further is the third scene. The lover puts his arm around his beloved's waist to encourage her to accompany him. (.) Now the lovers are going down to the shore, laughing as they head towards the ship; the men no longer need to beseech the maidens, who cling to their arms. Finally the pilgrims help their beloved on board the little ship, which is decked with blossom and fluttering pennons of red silk as it gently rocks like a golden dream upon the waves. The oarsmen are leaning on their oars, ready to row away. And already, little cupids, borne by zephyrs, fly overhead to guide the travelers towards the azure isle which lies on the horizn.""

77,Travel...,Sarcophage du roi Ramsès III,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/sarcophagus-box-ramesses-iii?selection=44898,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-sarcophage-roi-ramses-iii.jpg?1527818366,"
This pink granite cartouche-shaped box once contained the nest of coffins of Pharaoh Ramesses III. The lid is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The outside of the box is engraved with the seventh and eighth chapters of the ""Book of Amduat"", and the inside with the first chapter of the ""Book of Gates."" Certain parts of these texts were very carelessly engraved.
Description
The decoration of this monolithic cartouche-shaped block is organized around the large winged figure of Isis at the feet of the deceased (on the flat front of the sarcophagus) and that of Nephthys at his head (on the rounded back of the box). Both long sides are engraved with scenes taken from the ""Book of Hidden Chambers"" (the Amduat). The decoration begins near the figure of Nephthys at the king's head, with the seventh hour of the Amduat along the right side (looking from the head to the feet), and continues with the eighth hour along the left side. Around the base of the coffin is the palace façade motif - a relic of Old Kingdom sarcophagi (cf. sarcophagus of Abu Roach, Room 14). The inside of the box features large figures of deities from the first hour of the ""Book of Gates.""
The sun's night-time journey
The Egyptians imagined the sun to travel underground in a boat during the twelve hours of night. The nocturnal sun was represented as a man with a ram's head. Every ""hour"" (i.e. every stage of his journey) was marked by a particular event: at the seventh hour, for example (right-hand side of the coffin), the sun confronts the snake Apophis, the ""evil serpent"" of Egyptian texts, who tries to stop him on his course. The sun-god is portrayed armed with knives to destroy him. The left-hand side represents the eighth hour: on the lower register, the creatures of the Underworld are depicted, sitting on the ideogram for fabric (one of the essential funerary offerings). The texts referring to the sun's night-time journey (""Litanies of the Sun"", ""Amduat"", ""Book of Gates"", ""Book of Night"", etc.) were composed during the New Kingdom for the exclusive use of the king. As the pharaoh was associated with the sun god and his perilous journey through the night, the royal tomb featured representations of this recurrent event. After the New Kingdom, some of these texts (especially the Amduat) were also used for the benefit of priests and soldiers who were at the peak of their influence at that time (see the papyri in vitrine 4).
Slapdash work
Only two scenes from the Amduat are illustrated on the sarcophagus of Ramesses III, which is characterized by extraordinary carelessness on the part of the scribe who engraved the introductory text to the seventh hour (to the right of the figure of Nephthys). The phrases (and even individual words) are cut up into incoherent elements that cannot be understood without referring to the correct version featured in other tombs. This poor reproduction, without subsequent checking, suggests that, in the late New Kingdom, the monarchy was no longer treated with the respect it had once inspired.

	Beyond traditional iconography

	After his resurrection, Christ appears several times to his disciples. Here we have a cameo glimpse to the left into the scene of Christ meeting the pilgrims on the road to Emmaus; the episode continues in the foreground of the composition, where during the meal Jesus lifts his eyes to the sky at the moment of blessing the bread. This divine gesture leads to his being recognized by two astonished apostles.
	Veronese doesn't limit himself to traditional iconography. He situates the miracle in a palace instead of an inn, before a door with a triangular pediment flanked by fluted columns. Above all, he introduces into the middle of this religious scene a family whose members show little interest in the event. The contrast is all the more marked by the mixing of antique dress with the rich Venetian costumes in the fashion of the period.

	Religious scene and group portrait

	The abundance of anecdotal scenes makes the reading of the work somewhat difficult. For example, the graceful charm of the young blond girls playing with a dog in the foreground nearly detracts from the main subject. These children occupy a strategic axis, since their placement at the level of the viewer reveals the artist's deliberate intention to create a veritable mise-en-scène, transforming the sacred site into a theatrical space. In this work from his youth, Veronese is still trying to master his style. He mixes genres, historical painting, and group portrait, while affirming his taste for architecture set against a blue sky. This painting, whose patron is unknown, is the artist's first large religious work and a precursor to the scenic effects of The Wedding Feast at Cana.

The genre painter Louis-Léopold Boilly is illustrating a hitherto undepicted urban scene, the arrival of a stagecoach, and consequentlly the increasing role of travel in France in the early nineteenth century. Boilly, a precursor of the  ""painter of modern life"", chronicles social life by representing people of different classes and professions. His formal model is 17th-century Dutch genre painting.  
A slice of modern life
A diligence has just arrived in the cour des Messageries, where stagecoaches converged from all over France and Europe in the early 19th century. The stagecoach is in the parking space reserved for coaches coming from northern France and Belgium, indicated by the inscription on the wall. The people are of different social standing and ages: in the middle, a bourgeois being welcomed by his wife; on the left, a soldier with his arm around a flower seller who has her eye on an elegant officer; an old woman, perhaps a poor émigré, still sitting in the coach; delivery boys unloading packages. Boilly is above all interested in the scene's sentimental aspect, but he also evokes the growing role of transport in the early 19th century with the Napoleonic wars and the development of capitalism. He is describing an everyday urban event, a scene which falls within the domain of genre painting and was therefore considered inferior to history painting. This subject was unprecedented in the iconographic tradition of French genre painting, notably in the 18th century, for example in the work of Greuze. 
A genre painting during the neoclassical period
Louis-Léopold Boilly painted this canvas in 1803 and presented it at the 1804 Salon, where he hoped to find a buyer. Although the picture was greatly appreciated, he did not sell it until much later. The work is in his second manner, which he developed during the Empire. During the Ancien Régime, Boilly had begun his career painting amorous subjects in the northern tradition. The Revolution enabled him to exhibit at the Salon but he was obliged to change his subject matter, which was considered immoral. He turned first to portraiture and was acclaimed at the 1798 Salon for his striking group portrait, Gathering of Artists in Isabey's Studio (Musée du Louvre). The Arrival of the Stagecoach is one of Boilly's first depictions of urban life, a genre which became his specialty (The Shower, Musée du Louvre). He was fond of chronicling social life, and can be considered a ""painter of modern life"" before his time. 
An illusionist painting
Boilly is representing a real-life scene, for which he made a preparatory drawing (Musée du Louvre). The canvas includes several portraits. The man being kissed by his wife is the painter Guillon-Lethière, Boilly's friend. The groups of figures are harmoniously placed to the sides in the foreground and in the center further back. They all stand out against the long diagonal of the façade of the Messageries. Boilly's painstakingly detailed porcelain-like technique shows his admiration for 17th-century Dutch painting (Dou, Van Mieris).

""No canvas better reveals the future of a great painter"" - it was with these words that Thiers in 1822 described the first work submitted to the Salon by Delacroix, then still in his early twenties. With this novel subject inspired by Dante's Inferno, the somber conception and profoundly dramatic composition, as well as references to Michelangelo and Rubens, the artist pushed painting in a new direction, soon to be qualified as ""romantic.""
New boldness
The time of classical painters imitating Greek and Roman art was over: they no longer had a place in current tastes. The underlying idea behind The Barque of Dante is that great geniuses from other lands have written works suffused with a way of seeing and feeling quite different from that of the French. Reading them stimulates the mind through new subject matter and the imagination through new boldness. So new, in fact, that Delacroix's painting was not without its critics: ""a real daub"" was how Delécluze, a disciple of David, described it. Delacroix drew on the visionary writing of the Italian poet in order to create a painting of definite force and romanticism.
Making way towards Hell
Although inspired by the mythological tradition, the subject of the work is the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). In the Divine Comedy (1306-21), Dante recounts his poetic visit to Hell, guided by Virgil. The Divine Comedy is divided into three parts: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Dante's voyage begins in Hell in the company of the Roman poet, passing through nine successive circles on his way to meet Beatrice, who will guide him through Paradise. In this scene, Dante and Virgil, piloted by Phlegyas, cross the lake surrounding the infernal city of Dis; the souls of the damned writhe in the water, trying to escape their fate by hanging onto the boat.

The drawn fireplace that frames this work indicates that it belonged to Giorgio Vasari's collection for his great work, Lives of the Most Eminent Artists, Sculptors and Architects (1568). The drawings, grouped in one book, were published alongside the Lives. The finest drawings were also described. This was the case with The Fall of Icarus, which was on view at the Museum up until about 1845, was afterward declared lost, and was finally ""rediscovered"" in 1979.
Flying too close to the sun
According to legend, Icarus ignored his father Daedalus's warnings and flew too close to the chariot carrying the sun across the heavens, melting the wax in his wings and falling to his death. The presence of the chariot is indicated by the four foreshortened horses on the right of the sheet. In the center is the twisted figure of Icarus. His disintegrating wings and the look of terror on his face are drawn very realistically. On the left is Daedalus, turning towards his son. His expression reflects his anguish at not being able to save the boy, while the glance the two figures are exchanging is an indication that they both realize what is about to happen. At the top of the sheet are two signs of the Zodiac, Cancer and Leo. The swirl of clouds accentuates the worm's-eye view perspective, which is powerfully expressive. The drawing is framed by a fireplace flanked by two terms in profile. The artist's name is given in a cartouche beneath the drawing. The upper part, originally depicting a pediment and a medallion bearing a portrait of Vasari, has been cut off.
The other mythological Fall
In the Lives, Vasari noted that the Fall of Icarus was painted on the ceiling of an antechamber in the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. However, none of the frescoes in the palace seem to contain this iconography. The only room with a similar theme is the Room of the Eagles, which contains an octagonal painting in oil on plaster depicting the Fall of Phaeton. A number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain this discrepancy. The drawing may have been used for a fresco that was later destroyed for some reason, or the theme may have been replaced by the story of Phaeton. Another possible explanation is that while Vasari's work remains an extremely important milestone in historiography, it is nonetheless known to be occasionally at odds with known sources and proven facts.
The reality of a tragedy
This very large sheet, dating from about 1536, distinguishes itself from the perfunctory style generally used for demonstration pieces or modelli. In this case, the composition is characterized by its extremely high technical quality. The fact that this is a finished drawing, ready to be transferred to the intended support, is shown by the light traces of squaring on the paper and the careful yet confident lines of the drawing. Yet the work still retains a certain freshness in the narration even in this final phase. The additions in pen and ink give a natural air, which was rare in Giulio Romano's work for this type of drawing.

Claude Lorrain sets this journey of initiation against the poetic backdrop of southern Italy, in a landscape bathed by the light of the setting sun. The sense of melancholy generated by the soft, iridescent light lends a depth and gravity to the scene, reminding us that the drawing dates from the last years of the artist's life.
	 

	A voyage of initiation

	This drawing illustrates one of the best known and most frequently portrayed episodes from Virgil's Aeneid (Book VI, 260-263). In a landscape bathed by the light of the setting sun, the Sibyl of Cumae leads Aeneas into the forest concealing the entry to Hades. Relinquishing for a time the bright world above, the hero - the embodiment of the human soul - embarks on a voyage of initiation: guided by Wisdom in the form of the Sibyl, he discovers in the Underworld the vices he must avoid if he is to gain admission to the Elysian Fields. In the background can be seen the Bay of Naples, a frequent presence in the painter's late works and doubtless a memory of his stay in that city circa 1616-17.

	Virgil or Tasso?

	This is a preparatory drawing for Lorrain's painting of Aeneas and the Sibyl of Cumae, one of a series of four works commissioned by Prince Paolo Francesco Falconieri and executed between 1666 and 1673. The painting is now lost, but its composition is known from Drawing 183 of Claude's Liber Veritatis. This study features the same composition as the canvas, with several variations: the two figures are set closer to the center of the scene, the view towards the horizon is broader, and a round temple is visible to the right. The drawing is part of a series of five whose iconography leaves some doubt as to the artist's literary source: some commentators identify the scene as an illustration of a poem by Tasso, while others believe it adheres more closely to the text from Virgil. The central theme - a voyage of initiation - remains unchanged.

This type of perfume vase is decorated using a particular technique: line drawing in matt on a white ground for the composition, whereby a few strokes provide facial detail or render bodily volume. A delicate polychromy enhanced the drapery; barely fired, it has now partially disappeared. The iconography of these offerings is linked to their funerary destination: Charon, the ferryman of souls, draws his barge up to the tomb of the deceased, marked by a stele.
White-ground vases
Spanning barely a century, the “white-ground” style developed in Athens alongside the red figure technique. These vases, of limited production and use, are conspicuous in the finesse of their design and also in their extreme fragility. Bowls, alabastra, and lekythoi in particular feature among the vessels produced. The light slip ground on which the artist sketched out his subject in matt paint differentiates this series from all other Attic productions and relates it to mural art. During the latter half of the 5th century BC, a varied palette of colors was used and traces of this barely-fired delicate polychromy (red, pink, brown, purple, yellow, blue, or green) are still discernible. The lekythos, a perfume vase, was dedicated exclusively to funerary use. The oil or perfume it contained was used to anoint the corpse. The vase was then placed near the deathbed and buried or burned along with the body. After interment, it was also customary to bear lekythoi as offerings, to smear the stele with their perfumed oils, and to leave the vases on the tiers of the funerary monument or to break them there. These vases belonged to the deceased and as such could not be reused.
The Group R
The conventional name of the group led by the Reed Painter comes from the reeds, often depicted on vases, which mark the banks of the Acherusian Lake. The swift but deft and delicate design is enhanced by a rich polychromy. The subjects featured on the belly depict funerary scenes: a tomb visit, Thanatos (Death), or Charon the ferryman as in this piece. The Group R also incorporated battle or cavalryman scenes into its repertoire.
Funerary representations
Artists have decorated vases and votive tablets with funerary scenes ever since the Geometric period: scenes of lamentation, funeral processions, and entombments. The designs found on white-ground lekythoi offer a quite different death-related iconography: rather than depicting a ceremony, the artists drew their inspiration from beliefs linked to the afterlife. Alongside scenes of the prothesis (wake) of the departed are representations featuring the winged spirits Hypnos and Thanatos (Sleep and Death) transporting the deceased, Hermes Psychopompos (guide of souls) or, as in this piece, Charon the ferryman who escorted the dead across the Styx. On the lekythos in the Louvre, Charon moves his barge toward a stele. On the other side stands a woman bearing offerings, a basket, an alabastra, and a bowl. On the base of the stele is another offering, a lekythos. The scene before us is partly inspired by imagination (Charon), and partly by reality (the tomb visit). The artist has combined the visible and invisible worlds. Charon is depicted on lekythoi as an old seafarer, complete with pilos (a fur hat) and clad in an exomis (the short tunic worn by slaves). Originally merely the ferryman of the dead, he was later to become the demon of Death par excellence.

This bronze statuette, which has been said to be of Charlemagne, was discovered by Alexandre Lenoir in the treasury at Metz Cathedral in 1807 and is inspired by equestrian statues from antiquity, such as that of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The representation of Charlemagne or Charles the Bald as a horse-riding figure highlights the Carolingian emperors' interest in the thematic repertoire of antique art. The monarch, holding a globe and a sword (now missing), asserts his authority as a conqueror.
From Metz Cathedral to the Louvre
From the sixteenth century on, inventories of the treasury at Metz Cathedral list the presence of two statuettes of Charlemagne: one of gilded silver, made by the Metz silversmith François in 1507; the other of 'bronze' or 'gilded copper' and listed in 1567. The Louvre statuette would seem to correspond to the second of the two. Both statues appear again in the 1657 and 1682 inventories. The one in bronze, rediscovered in Metz in 1807 by Alexandre Lenoir (1793-1816), the founder and subsequently Director of the Musée des Monuments Français, remained in Lenoir's personal collection until the middle of the nineteenth century. It was sold by his heirs to M. Evans-Lombe and then acquired by the city of Paris for the sum of 5000 francs. After being damaged in a fire, the statuette was entrusted to the Musée Carnavalet and, in 1934, was exchanged for an object in the Louvre. Artists working in bronze in the Carolingian period took up the Gallo-Roman tradition of casting and based their works on examples from antiquity, such as the Regisole in Pavia or the gilded bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The latter, which was erected at some point before the sixteenth century in front of the basilica of Saint John Lateran, was thought in the Middle Ages to be a depiction of Constantine crushing paganism. The Louvre statuette might therefore be a portrait of a Carolingian ruler as the 'new Constantine'.
An Equestrian Bronze in Three Parts
The statuette was inspired by the equestrian bronzes of antiquity and is a rare extant example of the Carolingian bronze-casters' art. The whole consists of three parts - the horse, the rider's body and saddle, and the rider's head - cast separately in metals of different composition. The horse bears all the characteristics of antique or Late Empire horse statues and is thought to have been re-used, a hypothesis that would help explain why the horse was altered to match the rider, and why the saddle covers part of the reins and harness.
The Rider: Charlemagne? Charles the Bald?
The rider is certainly Carolingian, but the identity of the ruler remains a matter of dispute. The face does indeed correspond to depictions of Charlemagne on coins, as well as to the description of Charlemagne made by his biographer Eginhard. However, the rider could equally be Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, whose features, as known to us from manuscript illuminations, are deliberately reminiscent of those of his grandfather.

One of the artist's masterpieces from his mature period, this painting is a work of perfect clarity. The carnations on the floor are a symbol of filial and familial love. 

Archaic composition and subtle colors
This portrait is of an unidentified family in a comfortable bourgeois home. There are two couples, five little girls, and a young man. It was long believed that this was the artist's family, but archival records suggest that this is not the case, because Adriaen van Ostade had only one child, a daughter. The juxtaposition of the various figures in a stiff, formal line was rather old-fashioned even when the portrait was painted. Van Ostade borrowed the style of composition developed some twenty years previously by artists such as Nicolaes Elias and Pieter Jacobsz. Codde. However, the apparent formalityof the composition does not entirely mask the lightness and subtlety of van Ostade's art. Rather than contrasting the figures with a pale background in a highly decorative manner, as his predecessors did, he integrates them perfectly into the setting, creating a delicate, harmonious radiance that bathes each figure and object in light. The perfect mastery of tones and colors creates a warm, gentle atmosphere for the scene, prefiguring the superb refinement of the interiors of an artist like Gerard ter Borch.
A tranquil family scene
This portrait takes us into a peaceful bourgeois home. The room is decorated in a sober yet rich style typical of seventeenth-century Dutch interiors. The style is late Renaissance, with paintings, faience ware, and a sculpted chimney breast with small columns of red marble. These objects are both an indication of the family's wealth and symbols of their happiness. The painting contains many allusions to harmonious family life: the cherubs carved on the chimney breast represent the happiness of the couple, and the carnations and roses scattered on the floor symbolize abundance and well-being. The painting on the left seems to illustrate the words of Jesus, ""Suffer the little children to come unto me,"" a particularly fitting choice given the happy, secure faith of this family.
A work untypical of van Ostade's oeuvre
Adriaen van Ostade spent all his life and career in Haarlem, where he produced over eight hundred paintings. Nearly all of these works are limited to just two genres. Early on, he painted picturesque scenes of rustic peasantry, then moved on to scenes of bourgeois life. Only one other group portrait by van Ostade is known, a more intimate work now in the Museum Bredius in The Hague. The painting in the Louvre, with its touching blend of archaic austerity and subtle use of tone and color, is thus an exception in van Ostade's prolific body of work.

86,The Art of Portraiture,Portrait en pied de la marquise de Pompadour,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/full-length-portrait-marquise-de-pompadour?selection=44896,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-portrait-en-pied-de-la-marquise-de-pompadour_0.jpg?1527836865,"
This pastel portrait depicts one of the rare women to play a decisive role in the political, intellectual, and artistic life of the 18th century. First mistress and later friend of King Louis XV, she also aspired to be his counselor. Commissioned from the most famous and gifted pastelist of the period, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour, this masterpiece sheds light on the intentions of the Marquise de Pompadour, created as it was throughout the evolving relationship of an exceptional couple.

	A ""program"" work
The marquise is seated in a collector's cabinet decorated with blue-green paneling accented in gold. The sumptuousness of her clothing - a spectacular French-style dress in fashion around 1750 - shows a tendency to ostentation, while the absence of jewelry and the simplicity of her coiffure underscore the portrait's personal nature. She is shown as a protector of the arts, surrounded by attributes symbolizing literature, music, astronomy and engraving. Arranged on a table next to her in a splendid still life are Guarini's Pastor Fido, the Encyclopédie, Montesquieu's De l'esprit des lois, Voltaire's La Henriade, a globe, and Le Traité des pierres gravées by Pierre-Jean Mariette. Lastly, there is an engraving by the Count de Caylus, which, however, Delatour has signed ""Pompadour sculpsit"": an allusion to the marquise's fondness for engraving and her own creations in this art form. The presence of references to the arts and literature should be read here as an educational program. Still in love with Louis XV, she hoped to bring about in him a transformation through exposure to the extraordinary intellectual, moral, and philosophical developments which animated Paris at that time but which failed to reach the court, frozen as it was in principles and codes of etiquette.
	It is certain that the king saw this portrait; but did he grasp the double meaning of the works the marquise selected? While what was said between the two friends will always remain a mystery, the king clearly did not implement the liberal program suggested by his mistress.

	A difficult commission
The project for this portrait dates back to 1748 and its commission to 1749. In creating her portrait, Delatour knew that he would have to place his technical mastery and sense of psychological analysis in the service of the woman who dominated France. The artist and his subject already knew one another when the work was commissioned; they had met during the preparation of the pastel portrait of Louis XV, which was exhibited in the Salon of 1748 (Louvre, INV 2761). Despite this connection, the project met problems getting underway. Delatour tried with difficulty, resorting to diversions and alternating between legitimate excuses and bad faith, to comply with the marquise's shifting demands. There followed a long epistolary communication between Delatour and the Marquis de Marigny, who mediated on behalf of his sister in order to hasten the completion of a portrait that the artist seemed undecided about undertaking. It was completed, but didn't appear in the Salon until 1755.

	A turning point in portraiture
Delatour knew how to satisfy the demands of his patron: create an image that would correspond to her role and ambitions. Using only pastel pencils delicately heightened with gouache, he succeeded in evoking, through this official portrait, an air of intimacy. The marquise is presented in her home, surrounded by familiar and meaningful objects. This work signals the end of the fashion in codified official portraits, giving way, thanks to Delatour, to depictions as psychologically accurate as they were charged with meaning.

The candid gesture may be an allusion to Gabrielle's pregnancy and the birth in 1594 of César de Vendôme, the illegitimate son of Henry IV. 
Italian influence
Although very much in the style of the second school of Fontainebleau, this work remains anonymous. It shows the influence of Italian Renaissance art in the sensual contours of the bodies of the two young women, but also contains references to Flemish art, such as the intimacy of the background scene. 
The trompe-l'oeil technique
The artist has made skillful use of the trompe-l'oeil technique, using an imitative, realistic style for on the sheet in the bath and the two curtains framing the scene. The trompe-l'oeil effect is accentuated by the view of what is taking place in the background room. Richly colored, unsettling in its presentation of two women in their bath, and mysterious in its use of symbol - the ring being shown by Gabrielle d'Estrées, for example - the sensuality of the painting made it a popular success. Sensuous yet marvelously delicate, the contours of the two naked bodies are highlighted by the lighting of the two women from the left and the contrast with the shadowy background. 
An oddly affectionate gesture
The models have been identified as Gabrielle d'Estrées (1571-99), the favorite of Henry IV (1553-1610), and one of her sisters: the Duchess de Villars or Madame de Balagny. The oddly affectionate way in which the sister is pinching Gabrielle d'Estrées' right breast has often been taken as symbolizing the latter's pregnancy with the illegitimate child of Henry IV. This interpretation would seem to be confirmed by the scene of the young woman sewing - perhaps preparing a layette for the coming child - in the background. The picture was acquired by the Louvre in 1937.

This portrait was commissioned as a gift for Philip V of Spain. However, it was such a success at court that it was never sent to Spain. Every detail of the work is aimed at producing the quintessential image of absolute power: the nobility of the antique setting, the crimson curtain, and the solemnity of the Sun King wearing his coronation robes embroidered with the royal fleur de lys. 
Louis XIV
Louis XIV (1638-1715), the son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, was one of France's most important monarchs. He ruled from 1643 to 1715 and was known as the Sun King. His childhood was marked by the political troubles of the Fronde, so throughout his reign he sought to maintain the unity of the kingdom at all cost, crushing any moves the aristocracy made to obtain extra power. In 1660 he married Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1661, after the death of Cardinal Mazarin, finally free of his influence, Louis XIV wielded absolute power, but was shrewd enough to surround himself with devoted and talented ministers such as Colbert, Louvois, and Vauban. The royal purse, the army, industry, and administration were all reformed and trade blossomed. Louis XIV also greatly encouraged the arts. The château of Versailles is the finest achievement of his reign.
The king's coronation robes
At the time of the portrait, Louis XIV was 63 years old. He is shown wearing his coronation robes, the royal sword at his side, and holding the royal scepter. The crown is on a stool beside him. The painting of the robes is particularly detailed and refined, if somewhat overdone, reminding the viewer of the king's greatness. Other artists from Rigaud's studio must have worked on some parts of the painting, but the king's face - painted on paper mounted on the finished canvas - was the work of Rigaud himself, who produced a lifelike yet noble portrait.
A commission for the king of Spain
Louis XIV in fact commissioned the portrait as a gift for his grandson Philip V of Spain. The painting was shown at the 1704 Salon and then became part of the Louis XIV Collection. It remained in the royal collections until after the Revolution, when in 1793 it was handed over to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.

89,The Art of Portraiture,"Portrait of Louis-François Bertin, called Bertin the Elder (1766-1841), founder and director of the Journal des Débats politiques et littéraires",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/louis-francois-bertin?selection=44896,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-louis-francois-bertin.jpg?1527831293,"
The character and social status of Louis-François Bertin, who founded the Journal des Débats and backed Louis-Philippe, come to the fore in this painting. Ingres created the archetype of the triumphant bourgeoisie of the 1830s. This is the most realistic portrait he ever painted; the messy-haired sitter looks as though he has just been interrupted while in mid-conservation. This painting is also striking because of the amazingly sharp details.
A press baron
A stocky, gray-haired man of about 60 sits gazing intensely at the viewer. His facial expression, casual pose, and hands resting on his knees radiate a barely contained energy; he looks poised to spring into action. This portrait perfectly reflects the character and social status of Louis-François Bertin (1766-1841), journalist, businessman, and owner of the Journal des Débats. He backed the idea of a constitutional monarchy, which landed him in jail under the First Empire, and opposed the regime of Charles X. When Ingres painted this portrait, during the July Monarchy, Bertin's newspaper, which was read by the liberal bourgeoisie, supported the government of Louis-Philippe, whom he had helped to put on the throne.
""The Buddha of the bourgeoisie""
Ingres painted this portrait in 1832 during his Paris period, which lasted from 1824 to 1834. The revolutionary of 1806 was henceforth deemed David's successor, the defender of tradition against Delacroix and the Romantics. This was when the artist produced his painting manifestos, such as The Apotheosis of Homer (Louvre), but only a few portraits; he did most of them during other periods in his life. At the Salon of 1833, Ingres exhibited this picture next to an older portrait, Madame Duvauçay (1807, Chantilly, Musée Condé), to show how his style had evolved. The sitter's pose drew barbs from some critics, who found it ridiculous and vulgar. Later, Bertin's daughter wrote, ""My father looked like a great lord; Ingres turned him into a fat farmer."" This work, which is the most famous male portrait Ingres painted, is often considered the embodiment of a social class. Indeed, Édouard Manet described Bertin as ""the Buddha of the self-satisfied, well-to-do, triumphant bourgeoisie.""
Photographic truthfulness
This is probably Ingres's most realistic painting. Unlike his other portraits, such as Caroline Rivière (Louvre), the sitter's pose is not based on older pictures or Raphael's portraits. The artist captured Bertin as he observed him in mid-conversation at home one day. Ingres achieved painstakingly crisp precision in the details, the imperfections of the face, and the tousled hair; the reflection of a window on one of the chair's arms recalls the art of Jan Van Eyck. This work does not have the abstract contours of La Grande Odalisque (Louvre), but the malleable anatomy that the artist enjoyed depicting is in evidence, and his fondness for curves can be seen in Bertin's arm and the chair's backrest. Lastly, Ingres compressed the painting's space, as he often did.

Juliette Récamier, the wife of a Parisian banker, was one of the most famous socialites of her time. This portrait, showing her dressed in the ""antique style"" and surrounded by Pompeian furniture in an otherwise bare picture space, was extremely avant-garde for 1800. Exactly why it was never finished is unclear, but its state enables one to study David's technique before his vibrant preliminary brushwork and background rubbings were ""glazed over"" with translucent colors.  
An ideal of feminine elegance
Madame Récamier, gracefully reclined on a meridienne with her head turned towards the viewer, is dressed in a white antique-style sleeveless dress and is barefoot. The room is empty except for the antique-style sofa, stool and candelabra. She is seen from some distance, so her face is quite small, but this is less a portrait of a person than of an ideal of feminine elegance. Madame Récamier (1777-1849), although then only twenty-three, was already one of the most admired women of her time. The daughter of a notary, she epitomized the social ascension of the new post-revolutionary elite. Her husband, older than her, had become one of the principal financial backers of the First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte. In their mansion, restored by the architect Percier and furnished by the cabinetmaker Jacob, the couple entertained numerous writers, some of whom - like Benjamin Constant or Chateaubriand - fell passionately in love with Madame Récamier. 
One of David's whims
Commissioned by Madame Récamier in 1800, the picture remained unfinished for reasons unknown. David was not satisfied with it and wanted to rework it but Madame Récamier, who thought David worked too slowly, commissioned one of his pupils to paint her portrait instead. Vexed by this, David said to his model: ""Women have their whims, and so do artists; allow me to satisfy mine by keeping this portrait."" The painting remained in his studio, unfinished, and was probably not seen by the public until after it entered the Louvre in 1826. In 1864, Théophile Gautier wrote of Madame Récamier's ""indescribable attraction, like the poetry of the unknown.""
The esthetic of the unfinished
One of the work's innovative aspects is its horizontal format, unusual for a portrait, and habitually reserved for history paintings. The bare space around the figure emphasizes the elegant arabesque of Madame Récamier's reclined body. Her antique pose, the bare décor and light dress all epitomize neoclassical ideals. The clear harmony of the ensemble, due to Juliette Récamier's white dress, is brightened up by the warm hues of the furniture. Only the model's head is nearly finished, and David has not yet added highlights to the impasto of her dress. The accessories, walls and floor are merely sketched in with vibrant brushstrokes, with the white undercoat still showing through in places. The canvas' unfinished state gives the picture a mysterious, poetic appearance doubtless very different to the finished portrait David had in mind. After the minutely detailed portraits he painted during the Ancien Régime, several of David's portraits after the Revolution have unfinished backgrounds (Madame Trudaine, Musée du Louvre).

91,The Art of Portraiture,"<i>Portrait of Lisa Gherardini</i>, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, known as the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (the <i>Joconde</i> in French)",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo?selection=44896,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-portrait-de-lisa-gherardini-epouse-de-francesco-del-giocondo-dite-monna-lisa-la-gioconda-ou-la-jocon.jpg?1527831862,"
This portrait was doubtless started in Florence around 1503. It is thought to be of Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine cloth merchant named Francesco del Giocondo - hence the alternative title, La Gioconda. However, Leonardo seems to have taken the completed portrait to France rather than giving it to the person who commissioned it. After his death, the painting entered François I's collection.

	Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco Giocondo
The history of the Mona Lisa is shrouded in mystery. Among the aspects which remain unclear are the exact identity of the sitter, who commissioned the portrait, how long Leonardo worked on the painting, how long he kept it, and how it came to be in the French royal collection.
	The portrait may have been painted to mark one of two events - either when Francesco del Giocondo and his wife bought their own house in 1503, or when their second son, Andrea, was born in December 1502 after the death of a daughter in 1499. The delicate dark veil that covers Mona Lisa's hair is sometimes considered a mourning veil. In fact, such veils were commonly worn as a mark of virtue. Her clothing is unremarkable. Neither the yellow sleeves of her gown, nor her pleated gown, nor the scarf delicately draped round her shoulders are signs of aristocratic status.

	A new artistic formula
The Mona Lisa is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait. The painting is generous enough in its dimensions to include the arms and hands without them touching the frame. The portrait is painted to a realistic scale in the highly structured space where it has the fullness of volume of a sculpture in the round. The figure is shown in half-length, from the head to the waist, sitting in a chair whose arm is resting on balusters. She is resting her left arm on the arm of the chair, which is placed in front of a loggia, suggested by the parapet behind her and the two fragmentary columns framing the figure and forming a ""window"" looking out over the landscape. The perfection of this new artistic formula explains its immediate influence on Florentine and Lombard art of the early 16th century. Such aspects of the work as the three-quarter view of a figure against a landscape, the architectural setting, and the hands joined in the foreground were already extant in Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly in the works of Hans Memling. However, the spacial coherence, the atmospheric illusionism, the monumentality, and the sheer equilibrium of the work were all new. In fact, these aspects were also new to Leonardo's work, as none of his earlier portraits display such controlled majesty.

	An emblematic smile
The Mona Lisa's famous smile represents the sitter in the same way that the juniper branches represent Ginevra Benci and the ermine represents Cecilia Gallerani in their portraits, in Washington and Krakow respectively. It is a visual representation of the idea of happiness suggested by the word ""gioconda"" in Italian. Leonardo made this notion of happiness the central motif of the portrait: it is this notion which makes the work such an ideal. The nature of the landscape also plays a role. The middle distance, on the same level as the sitter's chest, is in warm colors. Men live in this space: there is a winding road and a bridge. This space represents the transition between the space of the sitter and the far distance, where the landscape becomes a wild and uninhabited space of rocks and water which stretches to the horizon, which Leonardo has cleverly drawn at the level of the sitter's eyes.

This moving portrait of a boy with an aged Florentine patrician disfigured by rhinophyma - acne rosacea - may in fact have been painted after the death of the latter: the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm has an excellent Ghirlandaio drawing showing the same man full face, with his eyes closed and apparently on his deathbed. The painting may also have allegorical significance. 
A dual portrait
An old man seated by a window holds in his arms a child whose delicate features are framed by blond ringlets. The man's gentle, benevolent smile and the child's trusting gaze convey their mutual affection. At the same time there is a striking difference in the way each is portrayed: shown in three-quarter view, the old man, recognizable as a Florentine patrician by the cappuccio on his shoulder, is shown with uncompromising realism, the light coming from the right enabling the painter to detail the gray hair, the wart on the forehead, the wrinkles around the eyes, and, especially, the nose deformed by rhinophyma. This image of age and the unsightliness induced by disease is in total contrast with the unsullied profile of the child, with his narrow nose and dainty mouth. 
An intimate atmosphere
Beginning with Fra Filippo Lippi 50 years earlier, the device of the window opening onto a meticulously detailed landscape - originally borrowed from Flemish painting - had often been employed by Florentine portraitists. The luminous red of the old man's fur-trimmed robe and the child's doublet and hat contrasts sharply with the gray of the pietra serena sandstone walls.The tight framing of the scene and the touching intensity of the looks being exchanged add to the intimate atmosphere suffusing this dual image of grandfather and grandson. But is this really a portrait from life?   
A commemorative painting?
A handsome drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum shows the same old man with the same disfigured nose, lying eyes closed on what seems to be his deathbed. The artist may have used this meticulous study to meet a request from the deceased's descendents for a commemorative work on wood. Thus the child is not necessarily the old man's grandson, but perhaps an invented being introduced to render the scene more narrative and poignant, in addition to highlighting the ancestor's goodness and greatness of soul.Ghirlandaio's exceptional skill and his ability to capture personality in his frescoes and paintings on wood earned him a host of commissions from the Florentine aristocracy of the late 15th century.

The youthful face stands out against a blue-gray background. Shown almost frontally, its perfect oval is set off by the regular lines of the drawn-back hair and the semicircle of the plait, from which emerges the gold head of a hairpin. The pearly flesh-tints with their pink touches are applied in small close-packed strokes. The large eyes look to the right, brought to life by two touches of white. Gold leaf hides a slender neck adorned by a pearl necklace.
A fascinating face
Her eyes turned to the right, the young woman does not look directly at the viewer. This detail, very rare in a mummy portrait, certainly contributes to her fascination. She is dressed in a purple tunic and a yellow cloak, which is fastened with a round brooch set with a large emerald. The large, prominent, and somewhat pointed ears are adorned with earrings each consisting of a dark stone set between two large pearls. A gold-headed hairpin fastens the plait at the crown of the head. Beneath the gold leaf applied to the neck, laboratory analysis has revealed a simple pearl necklace.
Gold, symbol of immortality
The portrait is painted on a wooden board, originally rectangular, cut to match the shape of the mummy, this distinctive form apparently being characteristic of the city of Antinoöpolis. Over this were applied several small squares of gold leaf, which cover the neck and part of the clothing, without however masking the oval of the face.The shine of gold, resembling that of the sun, made it a magical metal, a symbol of immortality. It was often applied to mummy portraits to cover the gray background around the head, the stucco frame around the portrait, or as here, to hide the neck. It never, however, obscures the features of the face, for the individuality of the deceased had to be preserved.
Exceptional technique
This portrait is painted on cedar, an imported wood. This was first covered with a black preparatory coat, on which the portrait was then painted in encaustic. The painter has exploited to the full the density of the wax, laying down fine, close-packed strokes which follow the modeling of the face, the curve of the eyebrows, and the arrangement of the hair. The eyelashes are rendered by scraping away the encaustic with a hard pointed tool to reveal the black ground beneath.

94,The Art of Portraiture,"Portrait of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC), called ""Hermes Azara""",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/portrait-alexander-great-356-323-bc?selection=44896,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-portrait-alexander-great-356.jpg?1527824023,"
Thanks to its original antique inscription, this figure can be definitely identified as Alexander the Great, son of Philip II of Macedon. The leonine hair brushed up from the forehead is characteristic of portraits of the Macedonian sovereign. The work is a copy of the head of a work from 330 BC attributed to Lysippos - doubtless the statue of Alexander with a bronze lance mentioned by Plutarch (Moralia, 360 d). The Louvre's small bronze, Br 370, is another copy of the same work.
Alexander the Great
This work takes the form of a herm: a pillar whose upper part has been sculpted in the shape of a head. It shows a young man, his head slightly lifted. The features are idealized, but there is a a degree of individualization in his inspired expression, and the mane of hair falling in strands on his forehead. The authenticity of the antique inscription - which identifies the bust as that of Alexander the Great -  is open to discussion, but the physiognomy of the figure leaves no doubt. The particular arrangement of the hair is well attested in other images of the Macedonian conqueror.
A diplomatic gift?
This bust was part of a gallery of herms featuring portraits of famous men,  unearthed in 1779 during an excavation at Tivoli organized by Joseph Nicolas Azara, the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See and, later, to France. For a time, this was the only known portrait of Alexander the Great; the value and significance of Azara's gift of it to Napoleon Bonaparte was, then, considerable. The date of the presentation is uncertain: according to some texts, Azara intended to offer it as a diplomatic gift during the negotiations surrounding the Armistice of Bologna in 1796, as a gauge of the Holy See's good will towards . Nevertheless, the inscription tells us that Napoleon received the herm during his time as First Consul, ie. not before 1803, the year in which he gave the work to the Louvre (as indicated by the inscription on the right-hand side of the pillar). The inscription, together with Bonaparte's other imperial symbols, was probably made after his downfall in 1815.
The echo of a lost statue
This bust was badly damaged during its time underground, and has been extensively restored. It is, nevertheless, the portrait of Alexander that comes closest to the work of Lysippos, a Greek artist of the fourth century BC. Lysippos's fame is due as much to his works in bronze as to his status as Alexander's official portraitist. Contemporary sources tell us that the sovereign authorized only three such artists: the sculptor Lysippos, the gem-engraver Pyrgoteles, and the painter Apelles. No direct trace of Lysippos's work has come down to us. Most antique bronze statues disappeared long ago, and are known only through small bronze copies or Roman versions in marble. The Azara Herm and the bronze Br 370 are copies of the same original, created by Lysippos around 330 BC. Alexander is shown looking upwards, as if to challenge the gods themselves. This vision of the inspired ruler, widely copied by Alexander's successors and imitators, became a standard model for Hellenistic royal portraiture.

The elegance and discretion of the dress, the intense but simple and natural presence of the model make this image of Castiglione, a friend of the artist and author of The Courtier (published 1528), the prime portrait of the accomplished gentleman and perfect courtier described in the book. This painting was probably executed in Rome in 1514–1515, on the occasion of Castiglione's appointment as ambassador to the pope by the Duke of Urbino.
Baldassare Castiglione
The portrait's subject is Baldassare Castiglione (1478–1529), poet, humanist, and ambassador, whom Raphael first met as a young man in Urbino. Famous for writing The Courtier, published in 1528 and dedicated to describing the ideal man of the court, Castiglione found a friend in Raphael, both men sharing the same ideas regarding beauty and harmony.
The courtier incarnate
This mutual affinity is perfectly expressed in Raphael's astonishingly simple and natural portrait, painted no doubt in accordance with the intentions of its model. Castiglione is depicted in a costume of remarkable elegance and discretion, in line with his concept of the accomplished gentleman. The ambassador's hair is wrapped in a turban over which sits a beret with a notched edge adorned with a medallion; his sober doublet is trimmed on the front and upper sleeves in gray squirrel fur laced with black ribbon; under it, a bloused white shirt. This winter dress suggests that the portrait was painted during the winter of 1514–1515 when Castiglione, appointed by the Duke of Urbino to Pope Leo X, was in Rome. Raphael had been working there since 1508.The sober harmony of the costume, limited to shades of black, gray and white, is extended in the painting's background of a light and warm gray-beige tone, bathed in diffused light into which the model's shadow gently fades on the right. The composition is bordered, as in the case of Raphael's other paintings, by a narrow black band, deliberately cutting the image off at the hands and focusing the viewer's attention on the face and the intense gaze.
A natural portrait
Castiglione is shown in three-quarter profile from the waist up, seated in an armchair merely suggested in the lower right, hands folded and his gaze fixed on the viewer; this posture, as well as the soft luminescence that envelopes the portrait, are a subtle homage to the Mona Lisa. It is certain that Raphael saw the painting during Leonardo's stay in Rome before the latter left for France. But the respective atmospheres of the two works, and no doubt the ambitions of the men who painted them, are markedly different. Referring to this portrait in a Latin elegy dedicated to his wife, Castiglione himself made mention of the uncanny resemblance and the feeling of human presence it emits. Above all, it is the naturalness— the immediacy, freedom of carriage, and expressive vivacity— which make this life-like portrait so extraordinarily modern.

Son of Charles d'Angoulême and Louise de Savoie, and cousin of King Louis XII whom he succeeded to the throne in 1515, François I wears the pendant of the Order of Saint Michael, which he served as Grand Master. The king's face is identical to an existing drawing by Clouet (Musée Condé, Chantilly). The modernity of the portrait is evident in the monumental and physical character of the bust, as well as the importance given to the hands; the date of execution has been judged at 1527-30.
Flemish realism and Italian influence
Following the example of the composition of Fouquet's Portrait of Charles VII, Jean Clouet depicts François I fully facing the viewer and casting a noble gaze. The king is richly attired in Italian style, but depicted without crown or scepter, the emblems of his station. The head, very slightly stylized, is precise in its details, painted after a drawing by Jean Clouet found today in the Chantilly museum. Despite the persistent realism of the Flemish school, everything in this painting is reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance artists: the subtle light, the shading of the face and hands, the realism of the folds in the clothing, the brilliance of the jewelry, and, of course, the framing - inspired as much by Fouquet as by Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci.
The Fontainebleau school
The Fontainebleau school, whose aesthetics were partly imported from Italy by Louis XII and François I, became the dominant influence in the French court of the 16th century. The school is characterized by a taste for the decorative, for ornament, mythological scenes, and sensual depictions of the female body. Its beginnings can be traced to the presence of the Italian artists Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio and Niccolo dell'Abbate during the construction of the Château de Fontainebleau, from 1526. Two Fontainebleau schools are generally distinguished: the first was influential during the reign of François I and Henri II, while the second corresponds to the artistic renewal that took place under Henri IV. 
François I, patron of the arts
During the period when this portrait of François I (1494-1547) was painted, probably around 1535, the conqueror of Marignan had already surmounted the political difficulties ensuing from his defeat at Pavia and his imprisonment at the hands of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. While reinforcing his political power, François I established a patronage of a breadth never before seen in France. The portrait remained in the Royal Collections after its commission from Clouet and subsequent delivery to the king. It entered the Louvre with the Royal Collections at the formation of the Muséum Central des Arts in 1793. It is customarily believed that the portrait was painted with the collaboration of François Clouet, the artist's son.

Raeburn is known for never having done preparatory drawings for his pictures. He began his career as a miniaturist and he had a gift for producing large, decisively painted portraits of men.
A gentle military man
In many cases, the impact of Raeburn's portraits stems from his remarkable economy of means, and in particular from a restricted palette. This is easy to discern in this picture, where the only colors on the canvas are red, white, black, and a few touches of blue in the decorative background. Yet the pose of this military man is in contrast to the formality of the subject. He is not posing in full military dress, simply carrying in one hand his imposing bearskin and in the other his saber. He seems to be at ease, and there is a gentle expression on his face; indeed, a certain joie de vivre can be detected in the major's still youthful features.The liveliness of Raeburn's brushwork enables him to add original touches such as a vivid and sensuous finish, as can be seen in the material of the uniform or the shininess of the major's boots. This new approach to technique was a novelty unfettered by tradition, and few of Raeburn's contemporaries grasped what he had achieved.
The military portrait
Military portraits were fashionable in England in the eighteenth century, as they allowed portraiture to reflect contemporary political and military conditions. The eighteenth century was a period of colonization and the creation and expansion of the United Kingdom. It was therefore important to depict and display likenesses of the people who had contributed to the stabilization and consolidation of British sovereignty.
A Scotsman in Great Britain
Sir Henry Raeburn began as an apprentice goldsmith and then worked as a miniaturist. At the age of twenty, he met David Martin, Allan Ramsay's principal assistant, who introduced him to the work of the greatest portraitists of the period. Raeburn paid particular attention to spontaneity of pose, as is especially evident in his method of starting a picture without doing a preparatory drawing. He preferred to paint portraits of men, which led to powerful and somewhat brutal representations of military men, men in power, and businessmen, whose masculine personalities shine through. The time Raeburn spent in Italy (1784-86) influenced him greatly.Raeburn was certainly the greatest Scottish portrait painter, or at least the only portraitist to have established his reputation while working solely in Scotland. Scotland had been joined to England (though not without difficulty) in 1707.

This enamel-painted copper medallion is a self-portrait of painter and miniaturist Jean Fouquet (Tours, 1415/20–1477/81). It was painted around 1452–1455 for Etienne Chevalier, member of the Council of King Charles VII and Treasurer of France, and once adorned the frame of a diptych in the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame de Melun. The diptych itself is now divided between the museums of Berlin (Etienne Chevalier presented by St. Stephen) and Antwerp (Virgin and Child surrounded by angels).

	A splendid frame

	According to past descriptions, the Melun Diptych once boasted a broad blue velvet surround decorated with medallions and embroidered true-love knots embellished with pearls. This frame appears to have featured a second medallion of the same size; it was destroyed in Berlin in 1945, and is known only from old photographs.
	The great enthroned Virgins by late 13th-century Tuscan artists may have inspired the idea of medallions set into a frame. When Fouquet visited Tuscany (from 1445–1448), he may have seen the splendid frame of the Madonna Rucellai (commissioned from Duccio in 1285 for Santa Maria Novella in Florence), its wood adorned with painted medallions.

	An illusionist technique

	Fouquet's self-portrait was executed on a plate of copper with shiny, dark blue enamel about 3 millimeters thick. He used two tones of gold (yellow and red) for the face and the letters of his signature, which he painted directly onto the enamel in long hatched strokes, creating a subtle monochrome effect. To create the relief of the face, Fouquet used a fine needlepoint to remove a layer of enamel at the eyebrows, eyelids, pupils, nose, mouth, inside the ear, and also at the neckline. These two techniques herald the Renaissance art of painted enamels.

	The first signed self-portrait

	Although the medallion in the Louvre belonged to the frame of a diptych, it is the first self-portrait by a painter which was not composed as part of a scene. Fouquet was undoubtedly influenced by Italian artists such as the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, whose sculpted self-portraits adorn the edges of the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery. Fouquet's innovation with regard to the Italian artists of the time, however, was his awareness of his status as an artist; he demonstrated this by adding his signature to his work, thereby claiming its authorship.

In his reception piece to the Académie, Desportes breaks with the tradition of atelier self-portraits. Instead, he gives himself the air of a man of quality, a lover of the hunt and nature. The meticulously rendered dogs and game are a direct allusion to his specialty as a painter of animals. 
An uncompromising self-portrait
This painting, with its brilliant execution and sense of color, is as successful in its treatment of the subject - it is an uncompromising self-portrait - as in its rendering of animals or landscape. This is the first important work by a painter who would go on to incarnate the century of Louis XV and develop his talent in themes of the hunt. In order to achieve perfection in the treatment of animals, landscapes, and accessories, Desportes worked a great deal from nature, creating numerous animal sketches and outdoor oil studies.
A reception piece
This is the reception piece offered to the Académie Royale by François Desportes, an early 18th-century painter of animals. The work remained in the Académie Collection until it entered the Muséum Central des Arts during the French Revolution in 1793. The Muséum would later become the Louvre.

This portrait of the artist was painted by Dürer when he was twenty-two years old, at the end of his trade guild tour of Germany. It is one of the very first independent self-portraits in Western painting. The thistle held by the artist is possibly a pledge of fidelity to his fiancée Agnes Frey, or perhaps an allusion to Christ's Passion (or more specifically to the spikes on the crown of thorns). 
One of the very first independent self-portraits
After serving his apprenticeship in his home town of Nuremberg, the young Dürer left to make a guild tour through southern Germany. This self-portrait dates from 1493 when he was twenty-two years old and probably in Strasbourg. In choosing to paint his own image, Dürer chose a unique subject: this was one of the very first independent self-portraits in Western painting. It is true that since the end of the Middle Ages painters had begun depicting themselves in their works (they were easily recognizable from the way they looked directly at the spectator). However, these self-portraits were only secondary elements in large compositions that usually had a religious subject. 
A realistic and sophisticated portrait
This portrait takes the form of a bust seen from a three-quarters angle against a dark background, and its composition is entirely consistent with the painting tradition of the time. The pose is a little awkward because the painter has constantly had to look at himself in the mirror. He is wearing sophisticated clothes: a little red cap with pompoms and an elegant overgarment of bluish gray which contrasts with the whiteness of the chemise with its wide embroidered neckline. The face still has some of the childish features seen in his early drawing of a Self-Portrait (1484, Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna), but the manly neck, the strong nose, and the vigorous hands are already those of an adult. Dürer, who was also an excellent engraver, composed his works in a very graphic fashion. The almost metallic fineness of detail, seen in the prickles of the thistle, also recalls his early training as a goldsmith. 
An engagement present or an allusion to Christ?
One interpretation of this self-portrait, which is said to stem from Goethe, is that it was an engagement present for Agnes Frey, whom Dürer was going to marry on his return to Nuremberg in 1494. In fact, the thistle held by the artist is called ""Mannstreu"" in German, which also means ""husband's fidelity."" This pledge of love would also explain the elegance of the costume. The main loophole in this hypothesis is that Dürer may still have been completely unaware of the marriage, which had been arranged by his father. Combined with the inscription on the picture next to the date, ""Things happen to me as it is written on high,"" the thistle could also be seen as a reference to Christ's Passion (or more specifically to the spikes on the crown of thorns). In this case, the work would be a forerunner of his Self-Portrait of 1500 (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), in which Dürer appears as the Salvator Mundi, the Savior of the World, a Christ-like figure crowned with the glory of God. Whatever the case, this self-portrait, combining as it does an artist's pride with very human humility, reveals the new social status to which painters now aspired. Dürer here demonstrates that art had evolved from the medieval tradition to a new phase, making him the first painter of the German Renaissance.

The well-read aristocrat and playwright Maria Rita Barrenechea (1757–1795) married the Count del Carpio, Marquis of Solana, in 1775. This work was painted shortly before the model's death.

	The portrait of a great lady

	Maria Rita Barrenechea, Marquesa de La Solana, married Juan de Mata Linares, a high official in Madrid who was very close to Jovellanos, lawyer and patron of Goya. The couple, who was friendly with the famous Duchess of Alba, lived near Goya's home in Madrid, and was typical of the ""enlightened"" Spanish who took an interest in reforms. The countess, who wrote moralistic plays, was renowned for her charity. Her portrait probably dates from late 1794 or early 1795; she died in December 1795.
	She wears a traditional black dress with a Basquine (bodice), and embroidered slippers. The unusual flower in her hair — consisting of large folds of pale pink ribbon — would appear to be a concession to contemporary fashion.

	The portait of a sick woman

	It seems that this bewitching portrait owes something of its quality to the mutual compassion between painter and model, who were both familiar with suffering. Goya must have admired the courage of this young woman of thirty-eight who knew herself doomed to die, yet stood tall, facing the artist with respect. The portrait is attractive despite the signs of illness; the huge black eyes gaze with gentle solemnity from the gaunt and feverish face. The extreme simplicity of layout and the gray background (free of all distractions) are reminiscent of portraits by Velázquez; the resulting soberness highlights the model's elegance. The transparent gray-blue background and the light gauze of the fichu, painted in delicate, juxtaposed strokes, are treated in an illusionist manner that heralds Impressionism.

	Goya, an avant-garde portraitist

	By the time he painted the moving portrait of the Marquesa de La Solana, Goya had perfected a personal style which brilliantly transposed and modernized the ""Velázquezian"" tradition. The recent influence of the great English portraitists Gainsborough and Reynolds (prints of whose works Goya had probably admired) is also perceptible. Goya's ceremonial portraits, with their conventional poses but sophisticated techniques (such as transparence to suggest precious fabrics) gave court ladies new life by accentuating their humanity. Goya perfected the genre with La Solana: an uncompromising psychological study, a dialog between portrait and viewer, a surprising symphony of blacks and grays, and the vibrant suggestion of fabrics, reconstructed by the eye. His avant-garde genius inspired several generations of European artists, including Delacroix and Manet in France.

Nothing left to chance
""Inspired by..."": these words clearly indicate that the work was undertaken in the studio, after a first ""impression"" which perhaps prompted a study or drawings. Here nothing is left to chance: the arrangement of the two terraces connected by a screen of plants, the hills receding into the horizon, the tree cut out against the sky, the dance of the peasants...
Revive the classical landscape
Corot did well to copy this image, whose creator was his painting master in 1822, the year this landscape was undertaken. The artist here shows a desire to revive the classical landscape by making use of realism and his own experiences in outdoor painting. The canvas was exhibited at the Salon of 1822, the year of Michallon's death. At only twenty-six years of age, he had painted his last great composition. It was purchased by the State at the end of the Salon.

This landscape - a northern Arcadia bathed in idealized Italianate light - is one of Cuyp's best known paintings. Its enchanting poetry ensured the success of Cuyp, the Claude Lorrain of Holland. The tower in the distance is not Utrecht Cathedral but the church of Rhenen.
A moment's rest
Aelbrecht Cuyp excelled in several genres: portraiture, landscape, still life, and animal painting. In this painting, one of the artist's greatest and most accomplished, he demonstrates his talents. A shepherd plays the flute for a young boy and girl, who listen to him attentively as they stroke a sheepdog. The chiaroscuro of the foreground sets off the warm russet and ocher hues of the cows. The anatomy and rippling muscles of these peaceful creatures are treated with great naturalist vigor. Cuyp even includes a highly realistic spurt of urine from the brown cow on the right. In the misty distance, beneath towering clouds, are the outlines of two windmills and a peaceful town reflected in the water. The tower of the church has been identified as that of Rhenen. The hazy grays are very close to those of Jan van Goyen. 
An Arcadian landscape
Cuyp establishes a monumental equilibrium, based on the diagonal dividing the painting, between the figures and the landscape's golden light effects. This fleeting moment could be either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the shadows engulfing the faces. Yet it is a moment tinged with melancholy: the gentle harmony of this pastoral scene is as tenuous as the invisible melody linking these beings. This familiar scene may be an allusion to Arcadia, the ideal landscape so often depicted by painters - in this case, an Arcadia of the North. 
The ""Dutch Claude Lorrain""
Cuyp never traveled to Italy but was greatly influenced by Italianate painters such as Jan Both. From this Dutch movement came his taste for highly structured compositions and the golden light in the foreground. His idealized light, rivaling that of Claude Lorrain, bathes typically northern scenes. This original synthesis earned him the nickname ""the Dutch Claude"" in the 18th century, and his charming pastoral poetry inspired Marcel Proust:""Cuyp, the setting sun dissolving in the limpid airclouded like water by a flight of wood pigeons,A golden mugginess clinging to the forehead of an ox or a birch,The blue incense of fine days smoking on the hill,The empy sky steeped in a swamp of clearness."" (Pastiches et mélanges, 1919)

This drawing, one of Polidoro da Caravaggio's finest, has been identified as a preparatory study for the landscape of the altarpiece, The Way to Calvary, which the artist painted in Messina in 1534. In the drawing one can see how Polidoro, once a pupil of Raphael's, responded to developments in Northern European art towards the end of his career.
Landscape and architecture
The landscape stretches out into the distance: in the middle foreground stands a solitary tree; in the background, classical buildings merge with the vegetation. The eye searches the horizon, lost among mountains and valleys. These details suggest that the drawing is a preparatory study for the background of a very large painting, and the most convincing argument has been made for Polidoro's altarpiece, The Way to Calvary (Capodimonte Museum, Naples), painted in Messina. Yet this hypothesis ignores the fact that in this painting Polidoro concentrates on an architectural ensemble inspired by the work of such architects as Bramante or Peruzzi, while the buildings in the drawing are classical. The argument finds support, however, in new data obtained during recent restoration work on the painting, which uncovered in the background a landscape with classical buildings, of which the drawing in the Louvre appears to be an early version. Painted by Polidoro in 1534, the altarpiece was commissioned by the Catalan brotherhood of Messina for their community's Church of the Annunciation. Marked by Polidoro's expressive naturalism, it is an example of the last style to be developed by the painter, and is a masterpiece of Southern European religious expression in the first half of the 16th century.
An excellent landscape artist
This small drawing's attribution to Polidoro was for a long time disputed, on account of the clearly visible Northern influences: the rapid line, the indistinct contours, the clear, soft light. Formal features connect this work to Polidoro's time in Sicily. The vibrant, vigorous use of pen and ink, without any watercolor or heightening in white, distinguishes it from the work of his Roman period, in which he concentrates on populated landscapes and ruins. In his Lives of the Artists (1568), Vasari says of Polidoro ""...veramente lavoro i paesi e macchie d'alberi e sassi meglio d'ogni pittore"" (an excellent landscape artist, better able than any other painter to render trees and rocks by patches of color).

Like all landscape artists, Claude Gellée had a liking for trees and made many studies of them throughout his career. This large pen and wash drawing of a stand of trees in a valley, with a river running by, is a work in itself, and not a preparatory study for a painting or an etching.

	An Arcadian vision

	Three large trees cast their shade on a group of shepherds in a valley near a river. A single shepherd on the left is keeping watch over the sheep and cattle. The tranquility of this pastoral scene is accentuated by the screen of high mountains in the background. The work is a perfect illustration of Claude Gellée's orderly, peaceful world, in which men and beasts live together, often without working, in beautiful countryside under always clear skies. This vision of the world has been called ""ideal"" or ""Arcadian""; it is often associated with the myth of The Golden Age. However, Claude's art largely escapes the features of the landscapes painted by other artists classified under the same labels, whose sources of inspiration were close to his. In fact, he seldom unleashes the elements or introduces tragic scenes.

	Independent drawings

	From the 1640s on, Claude drew more preparatory sketches for his paintings and executed fewer studies directly from nature. In his composite landscapes, he introduced scenes with various characters: shepherds keeping their flocks - as in this drawing - peasants, and mythological or Biblical scenes. But the emphasis is always on nature and on trees in particular. These independent works, inspired by direct contact with nature, are heroic views, which show a rather free style, despite the careful finish. They are drawn with a sure hand, exploring a relatively confined space with great care for detail.

	Nature recomposed

	The group of trees is a transfer - highlighted with several tones of wash and areas left white - of a pen and ink landscape in the British Museum, which was no doubt drawn from the same motif, but the layout, dimensions, and details such as the birds in the sky distinguish it from studies made from nature. The unusual size of this drawing, the precise pen strokes, and the composition are evidence that it is not a study from nature but a recomposition done in the studio. However, the harmonious arrangement of the volumes and the study of light - the trees outlined against the setting sun - do not seem artificial. As a picturesque combination of natural elements, the drawing is a successful recreation of a particular time of day. Along with the landscape in the British Museum, it has been compared to a very small painting on tin, executed in 1647, showing the same group of three trees in the center. But in the painting (Lord Methuen, Corsham Court, Wiltshire), the flock and the shepherds have been replaced by St. John the Baptist as a child, guided by two angels.

This fragment forms part of a group of mural paintings that decorated the chapel in the tomb of the scribe Unsu, grain accountant in the temple of the god Amun. The scenes depicted here show the succession of agricultural operations which Unsu had to supervise: plowing, sowing, harvesting, and the treading of the corn to separate the grain from the ear. The images read from the bottom up.

	A mural painting from the necropolis of Thebes

	These fragments were part of the vast collection bought by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1826. As the vendor, British consul Henry Salt (1780–1827), provided little information, the exact location of the tomb remains unknown. There is no doubt, however, that it lay in the civil necropolis of Thebes, not far from the Valley of the Kings. This group of pictures can be dated to the early 18th Dynasty, probably during the reign of Thutmosis III, a time when the practice of mural painting became widespread in Egypt.
	This enthusiasm for a technique already known for a long time has two explanations: firstly, the limestone in this area was of poor quality; secondly, painting murals was quicker than carving in stone.
	The surface of the walls was dressed with “muna,” a mixture of mud and chopped straw covered with a thin coat of plaster. This was used to smooth out the irregularities in the limestone in which the tombs were cut. The painting was in tempera, rather than fresco technique; apart from the carbon black, the colors used were derived from minerals, ground and mixed with a binder that has not been identified.

	A scene of everyday life

	Though the entrance to the burial chamber was walled up after the burial, the chapel would be left open for the living to perform funerary rites for the deceased. The decoration of the walls would thus be visible for all eternity.
	This kind of picture is often called a “scene of everyday life,” and it is true that some such scenes do help us understand the habits and customs of the Egyptians. Very often, indeed, they show the deceased in the exercise of his profession or office. It would seem, however, that most have a primarily magical function in ensuring the survival of the deceased: agricultural scenes would thus have been intended to provide a food supply for the tomb.

	Agricultural tasks

	Dressed only in loincloths, their heads shaved on account of the heat, the peasants are depicted in three different registers, engaged in the successive operations of the agricultural year.
	In the lower part, they cultivate the ground with hoes and a swing-plow. Unusually, the plow is drawn by men rather by oxen, while at their sides a sower broadcasts seed. Some are working in pairs, the presence of the second figure being signaled by the appearance of two eyes together, or the doubled outline of a leg.
	In the middle register, the harvesters are cutting the ears with sickles. The stalks were left, to provide food for livestock and to fertilize the earth. The harvesters are followed by the smaller figures of women gleaners, picking up fallen ears of corn.
	Finally, in the upper register, men carry baskets filled with ears of corn which are tipped out beneath the hooves of oxen, which tread the corn to separate the grain from the ear.

Are the lovers about to set sail for Cythera, or are they returning from the island of love? The question is still open. This superb painting was the reception piece that Watteau submitted to the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. The subject was so striking and so new that the expression ""fête galante"" was invented to describe it. 
Setting out for the island of love - or leaving it?
Watteau took five years to complete this large painting, which he submitted to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture as his reception piece. The reason it took him so long was that at the same time he was also working on the increasing number of private commissions that his growing reputation brought him. Watteau was given approval to submit the painting in 1712, but only actually submitted it in 1717. The work - The Pilgrimage to Cythera - proved to be one of his masterpieces, and he was admitted to the Academy as a painter of ""fêtes galantes"" - courtly scenes in an idyllic country setting. But does the work actually depict couples setting out for the island or returning from it? Art historians have come up with a wide variety of interpretations of the allegory of the voyage to the island of love. The work remained in the collections of the Academy until it was moved to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République - later the Musée du Louvre - in 1793. The work marks an important milestone in the history of 18th century art. Such was its success that Watteau painted a second version at the request of his friend Jean de Julienne. This second version is in the Friedrich II collection in the Charlottenburg palace in Berlin.
The myth of Cythera
In Antiquity, Cythera, one of the Greek islands, was thought to have a serious claim to be the birthplace of Aphrodite, goddess of love. The island thus became sacred to Aphrodite and love. The painting may have been inspired by certain 17th century operas or possibly a comedy by Dancourt entitled The Three Cousins, first performed in 1700. Watteau's masterpiece is an allegory of courtship and falling in love. The first couple is sitting absorbed in flirtatious conversation. They are next to a second pair who are just standing up, while a third pair are heading for the ship. The young woman is looking back in nostalgia at the place where she has spent so many happy hours. In the distance, a number of figures are climbing aboard a superb ship with cherubs hovering overhead. Critics have always admired the highly rhythmical structure of the painting, the subtle sense of continuity between the groups of figures, the vibrancy of the brushstrokes, and the beautiful colors. Without doubt, the mysterious hazy landscape in the distance is one of the most innovative features of the painting, reflecting the influence of the landscapes of Rubens and Leonardo da Vinci.
Rodin's opinion of the painting
""What you first notice at the front of the picture (.) is a group composed of a young maiden and her admirer. The man is wearing a cape embroidered with a pierced heart, a gracious symbol of the voyage that he wishes to embark upon. (.) her indifference to his entreaties is perhpas feigned (.) the pilgrim's staff and the breviary of love are still lying on the ground. (.) To the left of this group is another couple. The maiden is accepting the hand of her lover, who is helping her to stand. (.) A little further is the third scene. The lover puts his arm around his beloved's waist to encourage her to accompany him. (.) Now the lovers are going down to the shore, laughing as they head towards the ship; the men no longer need to beseech the maidens, who cling to their arms. Finally the pilgrims help their beloved on board the little ship, which is decked with blossom and fluttering pennons of red silk as it gently rocks like a golden dream upon the waves. The oarsmen are leaning on their oars, ready to row away. And already, little cupids, borne by zephyrs, fly overhead to guide the travelers towards the azure isle which lies on the horizn.""

This elegiac evocation of the ponds of Mortefontaine, near Senlis, illustrates the artist's evolution after 1850: a light, quivering touch and a hazy atmosphere. Corot may have been influenced by the blur of early landscape photographs, of which he had a wide-ranging collection.   
A carefully constructed recollection
In his studio the painter looks back to the ponds of Mortefontaine, near Ermenonville, which he often visited from 1850 onwards, studying the surface reflections and the play of light.  This is, however, a carefully assembled recollection, bringing together all his memories. After 1850 Corot's work became lyrical and his technique deliberately more elliptical in its use of a poetically misty atmosphere. Recollection of Mortefontaine is a masterpiece from this period of his maturity. 
Simple, rigorous composition
The simple rigorous compositional approach we see here is that arrived at by the 17th-century masters and learned by Corot from his teachers: in the foreground, a tree partially blocks the view, while behind it the pond stretches away into a bluish infinity merging with the sky. The gradually emerging atmosphere of spellbinding melancholy is created with a restricted palette in which the pale blues of sky and water harmonize with the browns and greens of the vegetation. The morning light effects have vanished. Compositional balance is achieved via the dissymmetry between the uncluttered right-hand side and, on the left, the three girls who replace the habitual pagan deities. 
Acquired by the state
Recollection of Mortefontaine was one of the first Corots acquired directly from the artist, in 1864. It was bought through Napoleon III's civil list and after a period at Fontainebleau it went to the Louvre in 1889.

Many 18th Dynasty tombs featured representations of the tomb owner hunting. This fragment shows birds flying away from a clump of papyrus, disturbed by a genet and a mongoose that are threatening their nests; we can distinguish a hoopoe, ducks, an owl, a heron, and even some butterflies. The fresh colors and the liveliness of the scene reflect the painter's skill.
The papyrus marsh, an Egyptian landscape
The extraordinary precision of paintings and reliefs from the Pharaonic period give us a clear picture of the landscapes of the time. Huge thickets of papyrus grew in the meanders and marshes bordering the Nile; their triangular stems bore green umbels that could reach a height of six meters. This plant has now disappeared from Egypt. In Antiquity, these papyrus thickets swarmed with animal life. Birds' nests swayed at the top of the stems which cobras, mongooses, and wild cats attempted to climb, while swarms of birds and insects flew above the water.
The first visitor
In 1822 Frédéric Cailliaud was the first Western man to enter the intact tomb of Neferhotep, the ""Overseer of the Two Granaries"" of Tuthmosis III or Amenophis II. The drawing he made shows precisely what the inside of the tomb looked like. It was also Frédéric Cailliaud who rediscovered the pyramids at Meroë (Sudan).
Wildlife scenes
This painting was the central part of a hunting and fishing scene, perhaps intended to entertain the deceased in the afterlife, or to symbolize the struggle against chaos (evoked by these marshy areas populated with wild animals). Such scenes featured in many tombs, from the Old Kingdom through the Late Period. The painter rendered this wildlife with a keen sense of observation, composition, and color. He painted the fluttering of butterflies and birds (wild ducks, hoopoe, heron, etc); one bird sits on its eggs, fledglings squawk in their nest and, below, a duck dives into the river. Two little carnivores take a great interest in this commotion: a mongoose (on the right) and a genet (on the left). The fan-shaped arrangement of the thicket is not disturbed by this intense activity, however. The dark green of the sturdy papyrus stems stands out against a light green semi-circular background. The umbels form a lovely decorative frieze against a white background: each one fits into the space defined by its neighbors. The umbels on the shortest stems are in bud, while the slightly taller ones have corollas; the tallest are in full bloom, their tips joining in a continuous yellow festoon, hatched with red.

Friedrich and German Romanticism
The painting shows a scene frequently encountered in the work of this painter, and is typical of German Romantic landscape painting. The composition is marked by simple forms and a strong coherence due to the diffuse light. The different vertical and horizontal shapes balance each other and create an atmosphere of serenity and meditation. The range of colors is limited, but treated with great subtlety.
A landscape with a religious message
The landscape communicates an authentic religious message to which each element of the composition contributes. The different naturalistic motifs painted by Friedrich are the symbols of a divine revelation. Man, facing nature, thus finds himself confronted with his condition and his destiny.
Nature, a reflection of the human condition
The foreground, which is darker than the background, features the earthly world. The fishing lines and the posts provide evidence of human toil. An almost supernatural light from above contrasts with this somber zone, and gives it an other-worldly feeling. The human condition is  represented by the fragile outlines of the fishing boats returning to port, racked by the wind and lost in the immensity of the horizon. Death is also present in the image of the stranded boat. Like an interloping ghost, it gives to the work its true depth in recalling dolefully an always imminent death. Finally, the moon whose light dominates the composition symbolizes Christ the savior of humanity, victorious over death.

Ruth, a poor Moabite servant, gains permission from Boaz to glean in his fieds. She becomes his wife and bears him a son, Obed, the grand-father of David, the ancestor of Christ.
The four seasons
Summer is part of a series of four canvases representing the seasons, painted by Poussin between 1660 and 1664 for Armand-Jean, duke of Richelieu. In 1665, the duke lost twenty-five paintings from his collection in a game of real tennis against the king; thirteen of them were by Poussin. The Seasons thus joined the royal collections at Versailles and subsequently the national collections in the Louvre. Each season is associated with a Biblical scene from the Old Testament and shows a particular time of day: Spring links the rebirth of nature to Adam and Eve in a morning landscape; Summer is characterized by the harvest and presents the story of Ruth and Boaz with the sun at its zenith; Autumn is evoked by the wine harvest and a late afternoon light showing grapes from Canaan; and, finally, Winter sets the scene of the Flood in a crepuscular light.
Landscape in painting and music
In a vast, sun-drenched landscape, reapers are busy harvesting barley. In the foreground, the painter depicts a story from the Book of Ruth. Ruth has fallen on hard times and goes to the fields to glean a few sheaves of grain. She happens to stray onto land belonging to Boaz who, moved by the young woman's plight, gives her permission to glean on his land and ends up taking her as his wife. A son, Obed, was later born to them, from whom Jesse and David, the ancestors of Christ, were descended. The story has been interpreted as prefiguring Christ's union with the Church. This painting, together with Autumn, is the most luminous of the series - Spring and Winter, the first and last paintings, are considerably darker. The cycle thus has the rhythm of a musical composition, with scenes of bustling activity framing more subdued ones. With his skillfully constructed landscapes, Poussin also imbues these works with a poetic quality in which nature and the atmosphere play a full part in the stories depicted.
A visual legacy
These four paintings, completed a year before Poussin's death, may be considered his visual legacy. In them we find all the essential features of his work, which was poetic, innovative, and complex. The depiction of the seasons is not in itself a novelty, but portraying them in the form of landscapes and introducing Biblical scenes into them is the painter's own invention. These works were greatly admired as soon as they arrived in France. The paintings has also given rise to many intrepretations, but the richness of their content has not been exhausted. And then there is the moving reminder of the trembling that afflicted the elderly painter's hands at the end of his life, evident in the free and slightly shaky execution of these works - a feature also present to a certain extent in Apollo and Daphne (Louvre), a painting left unfinished at the artist's death.

These two tapestries, made by the Ferrara workshop, were part of a famous five-part wall hanging representing Ovid's Metamorphoses. They reflect the 16th-century Italian taste for gardens and the Este court's predilection for complex, sophisticated themes. The iconographic program combines allusions to the power of the House of Este and ancient myths, both from Ovid's Metamorphoses (which gave their name to the tapestry) and from other ancient texts.
Myth and reality
Originally, the five or six parts of the tapestry were designed in the same overall format: a row of figures-half-human, half-tree-dominated the scene, whose background featured a view of Ferrara and its surroundings or one of the Este family's villas. The border was formed by a portico decorated with vine branches, with the Este eagle on the architrave. The scene is the Fall of Phaeton. At the top left, the young hero, struck by a bolt of lightning hurled by Jupiter, falls, dragging with him the chariot that carries the sun. His sisters, the Heliads, come to weep over his body and are transformed into trees. In the foreground, King Cygnus, who was very fond of Phaeton, has changed into a swan, while on the right, Argus, in the form of a peacock, is watching the nymph Io in the shape of a heifer. The iconography of the second tapestry is less clear. Three men and a woman are changing into trees. The inscription MELIA on the trunk topped with a woman's bust and branches of ash seems to be an allusion to the myth of the Meliads. In the background are the gardens, which lent their name to the tapestry, laid out around the famous artificial mount commissioned by the Este family. 
Ferrara tapestries
Tapestry workshops were founded in a number of Italian towns in the course of the 15th century. Tapestry weaving had been an important, albeit intermittent, industry in Ferrara for a century when Duke Ercole II d'Este decided in 1534 to set about reorganizing the workshops in his duchy. He was aware that tapestry was an impressive, not to say ostentatious, art form, and he fully intended to control its production to further his own power. There were already two Flemish weavers, Hans and Nicola Karcher, working in Ferrara, mainly as tapestry restorers. The duke enticed eight others to join them, including Jean Roost, to form an important new workshop run by Hans Karcher. The duke's initiative went no further in Ferrara, but it inspired other Italian princes, particularly in Florence, where Cosimo I de' Medici founded a workshop in 1545 that was to produce high-quality tapestries for two centuries. 
Flemish tradition and the modernity of the Italian Renaissance
Contrary to earlier workshops, the workshop set up by Ercole II d'Este employed weavers who were familiar both with a range of tapestry techniques and with the art of the Italian Renaissance. This meant that the weavers were able to follow with great fidelity the cartoons produced by artists. Meanwhile, the artists, who were often decorators, had learned to take the constraints of tapestry-making into account in their designs. The cartoons for this series of tapestries were by Battista Dossi (c.1490-1548), who drew inspiration from the frescoes by his brother Dosso Dossi in the Sala delle Eliadi in the Villa Imperiale in Pesaro. As was customary in the Flemish tradition, Hans Karcher used a narrow range of colors, playing on contrasting tones.

The excellent title, Le Coup de soleil (The Ray of Sunlight), dates back to the early nineteenth century. The painting, from the 1660s, is one of the artist's masterpieces. For him, it is a rare example of panoramic grandeur reminiscent of Rembrandt. The figures of bathers have sometimes (ingeniously) been attributed to Wouwerman.
An ideal landscape
This imaginary landscape by Jacob Van Ruisdael is a vast panorama based on subtle diagonals (clouds, rivers, hills) and composed around a number ol elements taken from the real world: windmills, the ruins of a small bridge and those of Brederode Castle (near Haarlem), and the hills of Gelderland or the Rhineland. A huge sky takes up two thirds of the painting; the tiny figures of bathers and of a horseman dressed in red enliven the broad landscape. This work reflects the trend for idealized landscapes in the European painting of the period.
A masterly ray of sunlight
Once simply referred to as 'The effect of the sun after the rain', this painting was not given the name Le Coup de soleil (The Ray of Sunlight) until the nineteenth century. And the painting's space is, indeed, brilliantly orchestrated by the sunlight, with alternating areas of light and shadow. The wheat fields are strongly lit by its rays; their bright yellow contrasts with the overall tonal harmony of gray-blue and green. The light also sculpts the fleecy banks of clouds on their slow and silent progress, conferring a peaceful, grandiose dynamism to the work. The atmosphere is heavy with humidity although the storm has passed, and there are still signs of rain in the distance.
Reference to Rembrandt
This composition, with its subtle diagonals and ruins among the hills, closely resembles the work of Rembrandt, notably his Landscape with a Castle (in the Louvre). The only splashes of color come from the small figures, which seem to have been painted by someone other than Ruisdael. A tradition dating back to the eighteenth century attributes them (quite plausibly) to Philips Wouwerman (who died in 1668); this would mean that The Ray of Sunlight dates from the 1660s. It is difficult to date this painting more precisely, since it resembles none of the artist's other works. It is one of Ruisdael's greatest paintings - a sublime and moving masterpiece, whose musicality inspires a feeling of dreamy melancholy.

This view of a beach in Dorset, on the south coast of England, was painted about 1818-19 and exhibited at the British Institution in 1819. At the time, it was slightly smaller than it is today; two strips of canvas added by the artist at the top and on the left-hand side can just be made out. The work, in its enlarged form, was engraved at Constable's request by David Lucas as one of the illustrations for Constable's volume English Landscape Scenery.
Between landscape painting and an evocation of elemental nature
Long vistas open out in this view of a Dorset shoreline. Apart from the rocks in the foreground and the heights of a cliff on the left, nothing obstructs the view, neither the heavy sky nor the choppy sea. There is nothing but a great expanse of beach, which two figures cross. The color palette goes hand in hand with the various facets of nature depicted: meadows in the distance are rendered in greens, and the shoreline and rocks are painted in ochres, orange tones, and chestnut browns. The stark contrast between the dark blue of the clouds and sea and the white of the foam indicate that a storm is about to break. The harmonious arrangement of the various elements of nature depicted is achieved with serried ranks of paint stokes that seem to marshal the whole of the landscape. Appealing to the viewer's imagination, Constable depicted the moment before the storm.
Observation of a storm
This picture dates to about 1818-19, a moment in Constable's career when the experience of being outdoors was at the heart of his work. In developing this theme, Constable sought out different atmospheric conditions in order to capture the various moments of the day. It was a period when he was particularly fascinated by the changing sky, and when his observations of nature took on an almost scientific aspect.In 1830 Constable added two strips of canvas, enlarging the upper part and the left-hand side of the painting. In doing so, he underlined the importance to him of the sea and sky, which are the real subjects of the picture. The same principle lies behind Constable's many different views of the city of Salisbury, which he painted at different times of the year and from various viewpoints over more than thirty years. Thus we now have representations of the small city at different seasons and under a variety of weather conditions.
The triumph of English landscape painting
While there was considerable French interest in British landscape painting, many years passed before it began to exert an influence on French artists. Constable's work gained wide public attention at the Salon of 1824.At the time, English landscape painters were striving to render in detail the various aspects of landscape by painting studies in the open air, surrounded by nature. Observation was the key word in landscape painting, and the goal was to be able to focus on precise details in the painted canvas.This simple and idyllic vision of the English countryside lives on as a celebration of nature in the face of the increasing industrialization and urbanization that England underwent in the nineteenth century.

This necklace is a remarkable example of jewelry from Achemenid Persia. It was discovered in 1901 by Jacques de Morgan during excavations in the Acropolis in Susa, in one of the few Achemenid sepulchers to have survived intact. The Achemenid dynasty was founded by Darius I, known as Darius the Great (522-486 BC). He recognized the strategic importance of Susa, the former Elamite capital, making it his own capital in the plains to match Persepolis, the capital of the highlands. 
An agate necklace
The necklace consists of 65 agate beads. The two largest are carved medallions measuring three centimeters in length and two centimeters across. These two beads were probably worn at the throat. Then there are 14 round beads a centimeter in diameter alternating with 11 hexagonal beads the same size, all decorated with a band round the middle. There are also 36 smaller olive-shaped beads, decorated with a white stripe round the middle, dividing them into two equal halves. The necklace is completed by two elongated beads. The necklace was strung in the form on display after it was found in 1901. The craftsmen who originally carved the beads used the veins of the agate to heighten the overall decorative effect. Very few pieces of Persian jewelry have survived, although the love of Persian dignitaries for costly luxuries is well documented. 
A necklace found in an Achemenid sepulcher
The beads were found in one of the few surviving Achemenid tombs, one of Jacques de Morgan's most significant finds. The body was laid on its back in a bronze sarcophagus shaped like a modern bathtub. The sarcophagus would originally have been placed in a vaulted tomb. Two coins from Arados dated between 350 and 332 BC were found in the tomb, indicating that the burial took place at the end of the Achemenid era. The upper part of the body was richly attired in jewelry made of gold and precious stones. Other costly items were placed alongside the legs. All the items taken from the grave are now on display in the Louvre. The identity of the deceased remains a mystery, although illustrations of men wearing similar types of jewelry would tend to suggest that the body was that of a man. Further evidence is provided by a text by the Greek historian Arrian, which records that Cyrus the Great was buried in a tomb in Pasargades with gold jewelry encrusted with precious stones. 
Precious stones from far-flung lands
The beads for this and similar pieces of jewelry were imported. Myths such as the epic of Gilgamesh reflect the value of such stones. In this legend, Gilgamesh undertakes a quest for immortality which takes him to the garden of the gods. There, he finds trees whose fruits, leaves, and flowers are made of delicate gemstones. This legend originally refers to the precious stones imported from far-distant lands lying to the east of Mesopotamia, beyond the Zagros mountains. The myth Lugal-e recounts the war which the stones, born to the monster Asakku, fought against the gods. After winning the war, the gods divided the stones into two groups - ordinary stones and precious gemstones, the latter blessed by the gods. This myth is thought to have been written to commemorate the victorious expedition of King Ur-Nammu, founder of the Ur III empire (2112-2094 BC) and of Gudea, Prince of Lagash (2120-2100 BC), who set out to open up the trading routes closed off by the fall of the Akkadian empire. A fragment held in the Louvre (AO 7748, Hymn to the god Ninurta and birth of the league of stones) recounts part of this episode.

This bronze fibula was found near Thebes in Boeotia, in a woman's grave dating from c.700 BC. The plaque is decorated with incised motifs inspired by Geometric pottery but with new orientalizing influences. One side depicts a grazing horse with a bird; the other a ship framed by birds and fish. The composition and the treatment of the ship's rigging have been found on other fibulae attributed to the ""Boatmaster"".
Boeotian fibulae
Fibulae were often made in bronze, as the color of this alloy after casting is similar to that of gold, and were used to arrange the folds of the tunic on the body. Some were used as temple offerings, and others were placed in graves, such as this large fibula with plaque found in a woman's grave near Thebes in Boeotia, along with three other bronze fibulae, two statuettes of hinds, an intaglio and strips of gold decorated with geometric motifs. Its imposing size and shape are characteristic of the fibulae with plaques produced in Boeotia. The principal feature is a rectangular plaque decorated with finely incised decorative motifs, the lower edge of which forms the catch for the pin. The pin is linked to the end one of a row of four shells that form the bow, via a double-spiral spring. The shells are engraved with lines and zigzags.
Narrative scenes and animal motifs
The decorative engraving on the plaque features a combination of an animal theme and a narrative scene. The reverse side depicts a horse, its head lowered as if grazing, and between its legs a bird with outspread wings. The space is filled with other motifs, including stars, zigzags, and chevrons. The front, meanwhile, bears the outline of a rigged ship with a crew of six sailors, floating on the broken line of the waves and framed by two birds in the sky and fish in the sea. The scene almost certainly illustrates an episode from the works of Homer, transcribed thanks to the invention of the Greek alphabet in the second half of the eighth century BC. Alternatively, it may relate to a contemporary scene taken from life, as the Greeks were mounting bold expeditions round the Mediterranean in search of fertile shores where they could settle and found new cities. The composition and treatment of the ship's rigging have been found on other fibulae attributed to the ""Boatmaster"".
A work lying between the Geometric style and new orientalizing influences
Made c. 700 BC, this fibula stands at the cusp of two periods and two stylistic trends. The craftsman who created it drew freely from the decorative repertoire of Geometric pottery, and the typical image of the horse with its characteristically shaped head, the warship and the zigzag filling motifs are borrowed from the Attic Dipylon vases of the eighth century BC. But the decoration also reflects the growing influence of orientalizing motifs, carried throughout the Mediterranean basin by commercial exchanges from the early seventh century BC. The fibula thus combines the decorative vocabulary of the Geometric style with themes from the Near East, such as real and imaginary animals and friezes depicting animals running and grazing.

Lavishly decorated with gold, turquoise and lapis lazuli, this bracelet set with lion's heads from the Achaemenid Persian period reflects the taste of dignitaries of the empire for jewelry and luxury. This type of object features in the sculptures decorating certain monuments, notably the Archers' Frieze in the palace of Darius at Susa (522-486 BC).
A bracelet set with roaring lion's heads
This bracelet from the Achaemenid period is a smooth, solid circular bangle six millimeters thick, with a slight inward bend in the middle of the circle. Each end is tipped with a lion's head with distinct anatomical features, similar to those found on the reliefs and enameled-brick panels in the palace of Darius I at Susa, particularly the Lion passant (Louvre Museum, aod489a). The muscle structure is shown with ""dots and commas."" This stylization, common in Achaemenian art, and the threatening appearance of the lions are also found on a rhyton decorated with lion's heads (Teheran Museum), a sword handle (Teheran Museum) and a lion-shaped weight (Louvre Museum, sb2718). On this bracelet, the cheeks and top of each lion's head are set with turquoise and the ruff is in lapis lazuli. The eyes and muzzle were originally incrustated, and the mane is decorated in cloisonné with pieces of turquoise. On either side of the heads are alternating incrustations of lapis lazuli and turquoise.
Objects found in a dignitary's grave
This object is part of a set of jewelry belonging to a dignitary of the Achaemenid empire, and has been associated with a bracelet (Louvre Museum, sb2761) and a torque (Louvre Museum, sb2760) decorated in a very similar manner to the bracelets. These items of jewelry were found in a grave at the acropolis at Susa, excavated in 1901 by Jacques de Morgan. A silver bowl and two alabaster vases completed the grave furnishings. Many bracelets of this type have been found, most having an identical shape to this one, others forming a perfect circle. They are all open-ended and decorated with the heads of animals (lions, ibex, gazelles, swans) and imaginary creatures (griffins, horned lions).
Jewelry worn by men
Jewelry was not only worn by women but also by certain dignitaries, such as those of Apadana in Persepolis, who wear ringed torques. The archers of Susa pictured on the brick panels at the palace of Darius (Louvre Museum, sb3302 to sb3311) also wear rings in their ears and a pair of bracelets similar to this one. The cloisonné and champlevé techniques were perfectly mastered by the Egyptians as early as the 14th century BC and were widely used in the Near East from the 1st millennium onward. This type of bronze and precious-metal jewelry and its decorative features were reproduced in western Iran throughout the 1st millennium. A number of fine specimens have been found in graves in Luristan, among the Treasures of Ziwiyé and Oxus. They were very popular with the Achaemenids: reliefs at Persepolis show delegations (probably Scythians or Sogdians, as well as Lydians, reputed for their expertise in gold and silverwork) bearing tributes in the form of bracelets decorated with animals confronting each other, very like this one.

This pair of bracelets was originally part of a parure, a matched set of jewelry, which was crafted from a parure executed in 1811 by the Maison Nitot for the Empress Marie-Louise (1791-1847). When he took the throne, Louis XVIII (1755-1824) had the imperial jewels unmounted to adapt them to current fashion. In 1816 Pierre-Nicolas Menière reset the rubies and diamonds of Marie-Louise for the Duchess of Angoulême (1775-1851).

	The parure of Marie-Louise

	Etienne Nitot (1750-1809) and his son François-Regnault Nitot (1779-1853), jewelers to Emperor Napoleon I, supplied Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon's second wife, with a parure of rubies and diamonds comprising a diadem, a crown, a necklace, a comb, a pair of earrings, a pair of bracelets, and a girdle. The bracelets were set with 24 rubies, 451 ""brilliants"" (diamonds), and 60 Dutch rose-cut diamonds. Placed at the Empress's disposal, this parure was immediately recorded in the inventory of Crown diamonds. Marie-Louise had little time to enjoy this sumptuous parure, as the Empire fell in 1814.

	The intervention of Louis XVIII

	Upon acceding to the throne in 1814, Louis XVIII had at his disposal the Crown jewels, an essential symbol of the monarchy. During the Hundred Days, when he went into exile, he took the jewels with him, and upon his return to power in 1815, he ordered the former empress's parure to be demounted so as to adapt the pieces to current fashion. Thus the rubies and diamonds of Marie-Louise were reset by Paul-Nicolas Menière following the designs of his son-in-law, Evrard Bapst, in memory of Marie-Antoinette, for Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte de France, previously called Madame Royale, who became Duchess of Angoulême by her marriage in 1799 to her first cousin, Louis-Antoine d'Artois, the eldest son of the Count of Artois (the future Charles X).

	The parure of the Duchess of Angoulême

	The new parure comprised a diadem, a necklace, a comb, a pair of earrings, a girdle, three clasps, and the pair of bracelets now in the Louvre. This parure was quite similar to that of Marie-Louise. Menière and Bapst kept Nitot's essential elements, but arranged them more soberly, in the characteristic style of the Restoration. The two bracelets were made of twenty-four oval rubies, surrounded by 356 round brilliants. The scarlet color of the rubies is set off by the sparkling whiteness of the diamonds. A regular frieze alternating ovolos and fleurons is interrupted in the center by an oblong oval adorned with three rubies. These bracelets, like the rest of the parure, traversed the different regimes of the nineteenth century without mishap, being worn by Queen Marie-Amélie, and later by Empress Eugénie. Under the Third Republic, the set was sold at auction in 1887, with other parures.

It was the custom of the kings of France to have their own personal crown made for their coronation. Louis XV commissioned two crowns: one in enameled gold and the other, now in the Louvre, in silver-gilt embellished with precious stones. In 1729, however, this crown was dismantled and the original jewels replaced with paste imitations. The crown was worn only at the coronation, after which it was placed in the abbey of Saint-Denis with the rest of the royal regalia. 

	A work composed of pearls and precious stones

The crown of Louis XV consists of an embroidered satin cap encircled by a metal band; springing from this are openwork arches surmounted by a fleur-de-lis. The band was originally bordered with two rows of pearls and set with eight colored stones (sapphires, rubies, topazes and emeralds) alternating with diamonds. At the base of the arches were five-diamond clusters forming fleurs-de-lis. The famous Regent diamond, purchased a few years before the coronation, adorned the flower at the front. The eight quadrangular diamonds that surmounted the flowers were from the set of eighteen Mazarin diamonds. The crown is topped by a fleur-de-lis formed from silver acanthus leaves, set originally with the Sancy diamond and seventeen others. A further twenty-four diamonds were sewn onto the cap. In 1729, the pearls and precious stones were replaced by paste imitations at the command of Louis XV. In all, the crown contained 282 diamonds (161 large and 121 small), 64 colored stones (including 16 rubies, 16 sapphires and 16 emeralds) and 237 pearls.

	The craftsmanship of Parisian jewelers

	Louis XV's personal crown was designed by the jeweler Claude Rondé and executed under the supervision of the young Augustin Duflos, jeweler to the king at the Galeries du Louvre. Shortly afterwards, in 1723, again working for Rondé, Duflos made a crown almost identical in design and size for King Joseph V of Portugal. In 1725, Rondé delivered another crown to the queen, similar in composition but smaller in size.

	Descriptions of the crown of Louis XV

	Two contemporary descriptions of this work have survived: the first was published in ""Le Mercure"" a month after the coronation, in November 1722, and the second appeared as a caption to an engraving by Sébastien Antoine. The latter specified that the crown was adorned with sixty-four colored stones, but mentioned only 273 diamonds and diverged in several other respects from its present appearance. It is therefore possible that its current form is not entirely faithful to the original composition, and that any differences may be the result of the restoration undertaken by the jeweler Maillard in 1780. Despite these slight modifications and being set with imitation stones, Louis XV's personal crown indicates both the sumptuous nature of royal ceremonial and the virtuoso skills of eighteenth-century jewelers.

Discovered in 1698 in Golconda, India, this stone immediately attracted the interest of Thomas Pitt, the English governor of Madras. Cut in England, it was then purchased for the French Crown at the behest of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans in 1717. The Regent surpassed in beauty and weight all the diamonds known in the western world until that time. Even today, its flawless brilliance and perfect cut ensure that it is still considered the finest diamond in the world.

	How the ""Regent"" was acquired and then cut in England

	Following its discovery in India in 1698, the stone was acquired by Thomas Pitt, Governor of Fort St George in Madras, for a very high price. The diamond weighed 426 carats before it was shipped to England in 1702 to be cut. This operation took two years, from 1704 to 1706, and produced several secondary stones, which were sold to Tsar Peter the Great. Performed by a jeweler by the name of Harris, this cut is the culmination of a technique possibly invented in Venice in the early seventeenth century: the brilliant cut. In this process, the angles, formed by the facets, are of a perfect cut, reflecting the light with matchless intensity and brilliance.

	The acquisition of the diamond by Philippe d'Orléans

	Taking advantage of the economic prosperity that developed in France under the influence of John Law, Philippe d'Orléans, regent from 1715 to 1723, persuaded the Regency Council to purchase the diamond on 6 June 1717. At the time, The Regent outshone all known diamonds in the western world, and by 1719 it had already tripled in value. Today, it is still considered the finest diamond in the world; its color is ""of the first water"", that is perfectly white and practically flawless. After the Regency, the gem remained one of the most precious of the Crown's treasures and adorned all the crowned heads of France.

	The ""Regent"" and the royal succession

The Regent was worn for the first time by Louis XV at the reception of a Turkish embassy in 1721. It was then mounted temporarily on the king's crown for his coronation ceremony on 25 October 1722. Shortly after his marriage to Maria Leczinska on 5 September 1725, Louis XV began wearing the diamond on his hat, a habit he continued throughout his reign. For the coronation of Louis XVI, on 11 June 1775, a new crown was made similar to that of Louis XV, featuring The Regent on the front. Like his grandfather, Louis XVI sported the gem on his hat. Stolen in 1792, then found again the following year hidden in some roof timbers, the diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat, before being permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801. The First Consul used it to embellish his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, the work of Nitot. Following changes in the ruling regime, the diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III, and finally on the Grecian diadem of Empress Eugénie.

In Late Bronze Age Cyprus (1600-1050 BC), the dead were often adorned with jewelry of fine sheet gold with repoussé decoration sewn onto cloth through small holes in the gold and then placed on the hair, the face, or the chest. This broad gold band is decorated with a pair of winged sphinxes facing a stylized tree, showing both Aegean and Levantine influences.
An ""international"" art
This thin sheet of beaten gold has repoussé decoration. Within a central rectangular panel are two winged sphinxes with elongated bodies, angular wings, and tails curled upwards; in their hair, they wear aigrettes like those depicted in paintings from Crete or Thera. The sphinxes are symmetrically arranged on either side of a stylized tree composed of a fleuron and a palmette with curling fronds. The whole is surrounded by a border of raised dots, within which, on the long sides, are circles of the same. The symmetrical winged sphinxes on either side of an ornamental plant element are a motif of Near Eastern inspiration, also found in Mycenaean Greece and through the 1st millennium. This type of composition is often found in the decorative arts of the Levant, on ivories, cylinder seals, and goldwork. The Louvre has a ring from Enkomi with a winged sphinx, for example. The stylized sapling or tree found in the middle of these symmetrical compositions certainly has a symbolic significance, and is sometimes called a ""sacred tree"" or ""tree of life."" 
Funerary jewelry
The gold is pierced at the middle of the short sides. From the same tomb at Enkomi comes another, elliptical band with decoration from the same die, which must have been of wood. These two pectorals, found at chest level on the remains in Tomb 2, particularly well-provided with funerary equipment, were probably sewn to pieces of fabric through the holes. Bands of this kind found in the Enkomi tombs adorned the forehead, hair, or chest of the deceased. The rosettes and spiral motifs of the decoration are part of the Near Eastern repertoire adopted in the Mediterranean.
Enkomi, a prosperous port
In the late 2nd millennium, Enkomi was a prosperous port that owed its wealth to the development of the copper mines and the growth of maritime trade. Founded in the 2nd millennium, this city, with its dense urban fabric, was surrounded by stone ramparts. Family tombs were dug beneath the houses, as in the Levant. Their plentiful funerary equipment, consisting of cosmetics jars in ivory, faience, or Egyptian alabaster, jewelry, and imported Mycenaean and Levantine pottery, testifies to Cyprus's involvement with the international art of the Late Bronze Age.

The necklace and earrings were originally part of a parure which Napoleon I presented to Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria on the occasion of their wedding in 1810, and which was subsequently bequeathed by the empress to Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany. The necklace alone comprises 32 emeralds (the center emerald weighs 13.75 metric carats), 874 brilliants, and 264 rose diamonds.

	The necklace and earrings

	The complete parure which Napoleon presented to Marie-Louise on the occasion of their wedding consisted of a tiara, a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a comb.
	The necklace comprises ten alternating oval and lozenge-shaped emeralds surrounded by diamonds. These are separated by palmettes, each of which encloses a small round emerald. A pear-shaped emerald surrounded by diamonds hangs from each large emerald. The center emerald (13.75 metric carats) is eight-sided. Each earring consists of a large pear-shaped emerald, embellished with brilliants and two smaller emeralds.

	François-Regnault Nitot

	For his wedding to the Austrian Archduchess on April 2, 1810, Napoleon commissioned two splendid parures from the jeweler ""Etienne Nitot et fils"": one of emeralds and diamonds, the other of opals and diamonds. Both were to become part of the young empress's private jewelry collection, unlike two dazzling parures (of diamonds, and of pearls and diamonds) and parures of lesser value (such as the gold and mosaic one, now in the Louvre) which were presented by the same jeweler on the same occasion, but listed in the inventory of the Crown Jewels. An expert evaluation of the emerald set, which was delivered at the end of March, provided information as to the composition of this private parure.
	""Etienne Nitot et fils"" was managed at that time by François-Regnault Nitot (1779–1853), who succeeded his father Etienne after the latter's death in March 1809.

	Well-traveled jewels

	When Marie-Louise left Paris on March 29, 1814, she took all her jewelry with her; she had to return the Crown Jewels to the emissary of the Bourbons, but kept her personal jewelry items. She bequeathed the emerald parure to her cousin Leopold II of Habsburg, Grand Duke of Tuscany, whose descendants kept it until 1953, when it was sold to the jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels. The emeralds from the tiara were then sold one by one; a wealthy American collector bought the tiara and had it set with turquoises instead of emeralds before bequeathing it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1966. The comb was transformed, but the necklace and pair of earrings were fortunately preserved in their original state, and joined the Louvre's collection in 2004 thanks to the Fonds du Patrimoine, the Friends of the Louvre, and the museum's management.

The fantastical design and technical virtuosity of these small barrel-shaped earrings testify to the refinement and wealth of Etruscan civilization during the Archaic period. Etruscan goldsmiths had long excelled in the use of techniques, such as filigree and graining, imported from the Near East. The earrings are decorated with repoussé bulls' heads, and geometric and plant motifs executed using fine gold threads and beads. 

	The Archaic period: a golden age of Etruscan metalwork

	This pair of earrings was purchased by the Louvre as part of the collection of the Marquis of Campana in 1863. Jewelry of this type was in widespread use in the second half of the 6th century BC, when Etruscan civilization flourished. Richly decorated gold items such as these have been found in numerous sepulchers; the exact origin of the present items is difficult to ascertain due to a lack of contextual archaeological evidence. They may have been made in Chiusi, in inland Etruria.

	Decorative fantasy

	The diverse motifs decorating this pair of small, barrel-shaped gold earrings testify to the creativity, originality, and imagination of Etruscan goldsmiths. Their surface is divided into two compartments marked by filigree threads. One side (the ""reverse,"" worn at the back) is decorated with palmettes and a rosette with lanceolated petals, while the front is decorated with spheres covered with fine graining, fruit, embossed, and repoussé plant motifs, and two protomes of bulls' heads.

	The technical virtuosity of Etruscan goldsmiths

	The earrings' refined decoration owes much to the technical accomplishments of the goldsmiths of the period. Techniques imported from the Near East during the Orientalizing period in the 7th century BC were quickly mastered by the Etruscans. The use of graining and filigree, in particular, enabled them to achieve remarkable effects of relief and chiaroscuro, capitalizing on the play of light across areas dotted with miniscule gold granules, and on fine gold threads used to outline and highlight the various motifs. The resulting details are remarkably fine and precise, despite the earrings' small size.

This gold necklace, from the early 5th century BC, is a splendid example of the imaginative decoration and virtuoso techniques used by Etruscan goldsmiths of the Archaic period. The repoussé pendant, with details in graining and filigree, represents the river god Achelous, identified by his extensive beard and bull-like horns. His image was thought to have protective powers. A masterpiece of the Campana collection, the pendant inspired a number of 19th-century copies. 

	A necklace from the late Archaic period

	The imaginative decoration and remarkably fine execution of this pendant make it one of the greatest and most original masterpieces of Etruscan art. It was acquired for the Louvre by Napoleon III in 1863, as part of the Marquis of Campana's major collection of antiquities. The pendant was probably made in about 480 BC; it is difficult to pinpoint its exact workshop of origin, however, due to a lack of contextual archaeological evidence.

	The protective role of the river god Achelous

	The pendant hangs from a small woven chain, and represents the river god Achelous, son of Oceanus and Thetys. Present in both Greek and Etruscan art, Achelous was known for his polymorphic abilities, and is often depicted as a bull with a human head. According to Greek mythology, he courted Deianira, whose husband Heracles succeeded in subduing him on several occasions, despite his terrifying guises. One of their many fights, in which Achelous took the form of an amulet designed to ward off evil, is depicted on a diadem in the Louvre collection.

	The technical prowess of Etruscan goldsmiths

	The pendant is the most famous piece in the Campana collection, and has inspired numerous modern copies, notably by 19th-century goldsmiths hoping (in vain) to emulate its technical mastery and refined detail. The techniques used were imported from the Middle East during the Orientalizing period, and quickly assimilated to near perfection. The finely modeled repoussé head is less than four centimeters long, highlighted with filigree and graining in unparalleled detail. The stylized hair is executed in spirals of fine gold thread, terminating in a centrally placed gold grain. The play of light across the miniscule gold beads making up the beard and part of the hair contrasts admirably with the smooth flesh of the face.

This extremely precious solid gold and lapis lazuli item of jewelry - a true masterpiece of antique goldwork - represents the holy triad of the Osiris family. Despite the presence of the god of death, this piece was more a temple treasure than a funerary jewel.
Osiris's Family
The three solid gold figures represent Osiris, surrounded by his son, Horus, and his wife, Isis. Horus and Isis extend their hands toward their father and husband's shoulder in a protective gesture. These gods are recognizable by their attributes: the feathered tiara and shroud for Osiris; the falcon head and double royal crown for Horus; and the horned disk for Isis, in imitation of the goddess Hathor. Osiris is crouching on a pillar of a deep blue lapis lazuli that places him at the same level as his family. The palm leaves on the cornice and the base are fashioned in gold cloisonné inlaid with lapis and red glass. The inlays of Horus and Isis's wigs are missing. Some of the details have been chased; others were added by barely visible welds. The sculptural quality of the figures is comparable to that of the best statues from the same period, for example, Karomama, the Divine Adoratrice, exhibited in the same room (Louvre Museum, N 500).
Inscriptions on the Base
The underside of the gold base has an engraved inscription; six columns remain. It reads, to the left: ""The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the master of the Two Lands, Usermaatre, the chosen of Amun, the son of Ra, the lord of the crowns, Osorkon beloved of Amun""; and opposite, from left to right: ""I grant you the years of Atum, like Ra, I grant you encompassing bravery and total victory, I give you countless jubilees; thus speaks Osiris Wennefer."" A plate of gilded silver was added at the feet of Isis during restoration at an unknown date; the end of the text is therefore missing. It may have been the key in pinpointing the actual origin of this crouching Osiris - a rare pose in statues of this god, who also dispenses words that are usually found in the mouths of other major dynastic gods, such as Amun and Ra. 
A Temple Jewel
The back of the engraved lapis column reads: ""King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Usermaatre, the chosen of Amun, son of Ra, Osorkon beloved of Amun."" Could this explain the crouching figure? On the same monument, Osorkon II would therefore be both a protégé of Osiris and an embodiment of the god, a status every king achieved after death. Yet the pharaoh is not described as ""Osiris-Osorkon"" as a deceased sovereign. On the other hand, the amulet figure cannot be from Osorkon II's tomb, which was found intact by Pierre Montet during excavations of Tanis, as it was sealed under a pile of older excavated earth. Furthermore, the text is not that of a piece of funerary jewelry, as Osiris is here considered to be a god protecting a living king. In the first millennium BC, many cult centers across the country were devoted to this deity. This piece of jewelry seems to be a temple treasure - an attribute that played a considerable religious role. Rings on the back could have been used to hang the object like a breastplate. This extremely valuable piece was probably altered to fulfill a new function, which may explain why the epithets of the god under the base were removed.

This splendid gold necklace is of exceptional quality and great originality. It consists of three chains composed of flat rings that are soldered together in pairs, and a rectangular pendant inlaid with lapis lazuli, that bears the name of Pinudjem I framed by two bees. Smaller chains, adorned with elegant floral pendants, are attached to the outer and inner chain and to the bottom of the rectangular pendant. This lovely necklace demonstrates the virtuosity of the goldsmiths of the period.
Sophisticated techniques
Square plaques, inserted at regular intervals, serve to hold the three main chains apart. These plaques were probably originally inlaid like the pendant. The latter bears the coronation name of King Pinudjem I—Kha-Kheper-Re—flanked by two royal bees symbolizing northern Egypt. The front of the pendant is decorated with cloisonné, a technique favored by the Egyptians. Gold partitions were soldered onto the metal plaque, and pieces of lapis lazuli fitted inside these partitions. This technique, in use since the Old Kingdom, is one of the most common in Egyptian gold and silver work. Gold was generally used in association with semiprecious stones such as carnelian, turquoise, and lapis lazuli. Similarly colorful effects could be created using faience, which was less expensive. The back of the pendant has an identical decoration worked in repoussé. The small floral pendants—a detail found on other jewelry items from this period—add a touch of lightness and originality to this impressive necklace.
Tradition and innovation
Splendid items of gold jewelry from this period have come down to us, especially from the royal tombs of Tanis but also from Memphis and, more rarely, from the Theban region. A certain number of these pieces feature motifs and techniques that resemble the ones used on this necklace. Such jewelry was clearly inspired by models from previous periods. The pendant, for example, was directly inspired by a type of pectoral originating in the Middle Kingdom in the form of a small chapel crowned by a cornice, usually made in cloisonné. The little floral pendants originated in the New Kingdom, during which period they were made in faience. The quantity of chains and floral pendants is quite typical of this period, which was also characterized by highly sophisticated metalworking techniques.
Pinudjem, high priest of Amun and king
While Smendes, the first king of the 21st Dynasty, ruled from the north of Egypt, a powerful line of High Priests of Amun was established in the south. The High Priest Pinudjem, whose wife was a daughter of Ramesses XI (the last Ramesside king), occupied a prominent place in Upper Egypt—and went so far as to claim the royal titulary. One of his sons succeeded to Smendes, under the name of Psusennes I.

This gold ring with a bezel bears the portrait of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (1371-1419). Combining several techniques-chasing, enamel, precious stones, and hard stone-this delicately worked piece reflects the exquisite taste of the early fifteenth-century court.

	A faithful likeness

	John the Fearless belonged to the ambitious and powerful Burgundian dynasty. The instigator of the assassination of Louis of Orléans, brother of King Charles VI, he himself was assassinated during the conflict between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians.
	Seen in profile from the right, this bust shows the duke wearing the chaperon or hood fashionable in the early fifteenth century. This faithful likeness resembles the portrait in the illuminated manuscript of the Livre des Merveilles, dating from circa 1410 and now in France's National Library. In all probability this sizeable ring belonged to the Duke of Burgundy himself. He is known to have liked this kind of jewelry: on his tomb, now in the museum in Dijon, he is shown wearing several rings on each hand.

	A combination of different techniques

	The face is sculpted from white agate, the black jade hat is decorated with a ruby, and the emerald garment has a fur collar of beige agate. Thus the piece combines chasing, enameling, and sculpture of hard stone. Both the exterior and interior of the ring bore inscriptions in black enamel: on the interior we can still make out some of the Gothic lettering of the Latin inscription, ""Truly this was the Son of God,"" uttered by one of the Roman centurions after Jesus' death (Matthew 27:54, Mark 15:39). Unfortunately, the inscription on the outside is now totally effaced. On the underside of the bezel, however, we can readily make out an engraved planing tool overlaid with orange-yellow enamel. The use of such emblems was widespread in the late Middle Ages and this one was adopted by John the Fearless in 1406.
	Cameo rings of this kind were very much in fashion at the time and we know that John of Berry, the Duke's uncle, had two of them. In its traditional combining of gold and colored stones, this piece reflects the fashion and taste for luxury of the style prevailing in the fifteenth century's first decade.

This funerary necklace is composed of three rows of beads made of glass and gilded wood, and a serpentine scarab. It was found on the mummy of Sennefer, in the cemetery of Deir el-Medina. There are long spindle-shaped beads, smaller elongated ones, and many small round ones. The scarab still bears significant traces of gilding, and a text exhorting the heart of the deceased not to bear witness against him in the Court of the dead.
Sennefer's tomb at Deir el-Medina
The tomb of the craftsman Sennefer was discovered in February 1928 in the workers' cemetery at Deir el-Medina, during excavations conducted by Bernard Bruyère. This modest-sized tomb contained the coffins of Sennefer and of his wife Nefertiti, placed side by side. At their head was a small coffin in which a child had been buried. The floor was strewn with bouquets which had been placed there during the funeral, and round about were a number of canes, a chest, a chair, an amphora, and some crockery containing provisions.The tomb was only partly pillaged during Antiquity, and the mummies of Sennefer and his wife were found intact. Sennefer's coffin contained a wooden headrest, an ebony cubit rod, and a few copper items. His mummy wore a gilded cartonnage mask, and wreaths of vine and lotus leaves. The scarab was placed over the heart, held in place by the necklace.
On the proper use of heart scarabs
The raison d'être of the heart scarab can be found in Chapter 30 B of the Book of the Dead (the great funerary work in use during the New Kingdom). Various versions of this, the ""Formula for preventing the heart of a man from opposing him in the underworld"", are inscribed on heart scarabs. The chapter is as follows: ""Oh my heart of my mother, oh my heart of my mother, oh my heart of my existence, do not stand against me when testifying, do not oppose me in the Council, do not show hostility toward me before the Keeper of the Balance. You are my heart, that is in my body, the god Khnum who makes my limbs sound. When you go to the fine place made ready for us in the Afterlife, do not cause my name to stink before the members of the court who judge men, make it good for us and pleasant for the judge. Utter no lies against me.."" The heart scarab was thus intended to ensure that the heart (the seat of consciousness) kept quiet during the perilous ""Weighing of the Heart"", a ceremony which had to be undergone before the deceased was granted access to the Afterlife. The reciting of this formula on the scarab was thus a supplementary precaution to ensure a peaceful second life.
Glass - a precious material
Sennefer's grave goods suggest that, although he may not have been truly wealthy, he could at least afford the kind of quality materials that were not necessarily found in every tomb. The gilded wooden beads in this necklace, for example, were less costly than gold ones. However, the large drop-shaped glass beads prove that Sennefer had access to this luxury material, which was characteristic of the late 18th Dynasty.

This gold fibula, found in Chiusi, is remarkable proof of the technical skill of Etruscan goldsmiths during the period of Oriental influence. It is richly decorated with geometrical motifs using the granulation technique then very fashionable in southern Etruria, particularly in Caere, where the clasp was probably made. The sheath bears one of the earliest Etrurian examples of an inscription, recording the gift from one aristocrat, Mamurke Turkisina, to another, Arath Velavesna.
Etruscan goldsmith work during the period of Oriental influence
This gold fibula was found in a grave in Castelluccio di Pienza, near Chiusi in Tuscany, shortly before the mid-19th century. The Louvre acquired it in 1863 after Napoleon III purchased the Marquis Campana's collection. It has a serpentine bow and a long sheath and was used to attach the flaps of a man's tunic. It was made in the 2nd half of the 7th century BC, probably in Caere, known in ancient times as Cerveteri. At that time, goldsmith work was undergoing a remarkable renaissance, which can be attributed to the wealth of the Etruscans, based on their development of mining. Another factor was the taste of Etruscan nobles for ostentatious luxury. Many such pieces of jewelry have been found in graves dating from the period of Oriental influence. The Chiusi fibula, however, seems to be the only one of its kind. It is an outstanding piece, both from the point of view of the richness of the decoration which reflects the technical mastery of the goldsmiths who excelled in techniques brought to Etruria from the Middle East, and the inscription on the sheath. The decoration consists of tiny gold beads forming geometric patterns. This technique, known as granulation, was very fashionable in southern Etruria, particularly in Caere. 
An inscription recording a gift from one aristocrat to another
The inscription on the sheath also uses the granulation technique. It is one of the earliest known records of the Etruscan language, which was first written in the region in circa 700 BC. The language is still not entirely understood, but it is easy to decipher because it takes its letters from the Greek alphabet. The object is represented as having its own voice, in keeping with an archaic tradition. The inscription ""mi arathia velavesnas zamathi mamurke mulvanike tursikina"" has been translated as ""I am Arath Velavesna's fibula, I was given by Mamurke Tursikina."" This inscription refers to the tradition of offering gifts, widely followed in aristocratic societies. The style of the lettering, typical of the Chiusi region, seems to suggest that the fibula was commissioned by an aristocrat who lived in this major city in inner Etruria.
The importance of the family bond
The names of the two aristocrats, the giver Mamurke Turkisina and the recipient Arath Velavesna, reflect the ever more widespread use of the combination of a name and surname rather than just one given name. This type of name prefigures the Roman system where each individual had three names - praenomen, nomen, and cognomen - highlighting the importance of the family bond. In this instance, Turkisina indicates the individual's ethnic status: he is an Etruscan - Tyrsenoi in Greek, Tusci in Latin. Dionysius of Halicarnassus noted in his Roman Antiquities (Book I, 30, 3) that the Etruscans also called themselves Rasenna, meaning ""those who belong to the city.""

Discovered near Corinth, this bronze bracelet testifies to the flowering of Greek jewelry during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. The ends of the piece are fashioned in the shape of a serpent, whose sinuous body, decorated with engraved scales, extends the fine, spiraling band forming the central part of the bracelet. Snakes, traditionally associated with the underworld, were a favorite motif in ancient Greek jewelry, possibly due to the widespread belief in their magic powers.
A spiral bracelet
This bronze bracelet, made in the 4th or 3rd century BC and discovered near Corinth in the northern Peloponnese, was purchased by the Louvre in the late 19th century. Formed from a smooth, flat band twisted into a spiral, its extremities, in the shape of the head and tail of a snake, were made separately, then gilded and soldered onto the central part of the bracelet. The reptile's scales are finely engraved along its body, with great naturalism and attention to detail. A bust from Cyrene, displayed with the Louvre's collection of Greek marbles, represents a young deceased woman wearing a similar bracelet on her left wrist. Snakes were commonly associated with the underworld, and its presence is a clue to the figure's purpose as a funerary object. Spiral bracelets of this type were made in the Greek world from the earliest times. Homer refers to the bracelets of Aphrodite as ""helikes"" (helixes or spirals), from a Greek term referring to any jewelry of this type, whether or not it represents a snake.
The snake motif
The snake, traditionally associated with the underworld, is a common motif in ancient Greek jewelry, possibly due to the widespread belief in its magic powers. Numerous bracelets and rings of the period take the form of a snake (see the ring BJ 1139 in the same display cabinet, for example), and were doubtless worn as good luck charms. The motif was especially popular during the Hellenistic period, and again in Roman times. Excavations at the House of the Faun in Pompeii have uncovered two similar bracelets in gold, now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, in Naples.
Hellenistic jewelry
The bracelet dates from the flowering of Greek jewelry-making, when gold from the mines of Macedonia was in abundant supply. The conquests of Alexander the Great, at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, brought about the dispersion of the fabulous treasures amassed by the Persians and the Hellenization of a great part of the Eastern world. Contact with the Middle East and Egypt gave rise to new tastes, in particular for polychrome pieces. Gold, bronze, and silver objects were now decorated with precious stones, pâte de verre, and enamel. New motifs, such as the snake, were also adopted by gold- and silversmiths.

This jewellery was modified over time to the tastes of Queen Hortense, Queen Marie-Amélie, and Isabelle of Orleans. It remained in the Orleans family until 1985. Although a number of portraits of the illustrious owners wearing the jewels are known, little is known about where they originated. Neither the artist nor the person who commissioned the pieces have been identified. However, the jewels are a precious testimony to the history of jewellery-making in Paris.

	Technical perfection

	The set consists of a diadem, a necklace, a pair of earrings and two small and one large brooch. All are set with Ceylon sapphires in their natural state - in other words, they have not been heat-treated to change their colour as is generally the case in jewellery-making today. The sapphires are ringed with diamonds set in gold. All the links of the necklace are articulated, reflecting the technical perfection of the set as a whole. The diadem was probably reduced in size between 1863 and 1873, as indicated by a comparison of the portrait of Marie-Amélie by Louis Hersent (1863, chateau of Versailles, on loan to the chateau of Compiègne) and the photographic portrait of Isabelle of Orleans, Duchesse of Guise (private collection). The comparison reveals that the diadem has changed slightly in the later portrait. The number of brooches now in the set is not the same as in the Hersent portrait, although this may be explained by the fact that parts of the diadem could be taken out and worn separately as a brooch.

	An illustrious history

	The earliest written record of this jewellery is in a letter relating to its purchase sent by the duke of Orleans, later King Louis-Philippe, to Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837), queen of Holland and later Duchess of Saint-Leu, its then owner. The jewellery was worn by Queen Marie-Amélie of France (1782-1866), who divided the set among her grandchildren as they married. Louis-Philippe, Count of Paris (1838-1894), the son of the duke of Orleans (1810-1842), bequeathed it to Philippe, Duke of Orleans (1869-1926), Isabelle of Orleans, duchess of Guise (1878-1961), and his successor as Count of Paris, who sold it to the Louvre in 1985.

	The mystery of the jewels

	It is generally believed that Queen Hortense acquired the jewellery from the Empress Josephine. However, there is no real proof of this. An Orleans family tradition that the jewels once belonged to Marie Antoinette complicates matters even further. It is difficult to obtain any firm proof about the past history of the jewels, which means that it is almost impossible to date them. The identity of the maker (or makers) is likewise unknown, partly because of the numerous additions and modifications that the jewellery has undergone. None of the pieces bear the hallmarks of any of the most respected jewellers of the nineteenth century - Nitot, Bapst, and Marguerite - who often worked for the royal family. Despite the mystery that surrounds it, the set of jewellery, named after the two queens who once owned it, Marie-Amélie and Hortense, is a remarkable tribute to the skills of Parisian jewellers in the early years of the nineteenth century.

The empress Josephine only owned this cabinet, which served as a jewelry case, for a short period of time. It was delivered to her in 1809, just before her divorce from Napoleon, and subsequently belonged to the empress Marie-Louise, the emperor's second wife. The cabinet is made of yew and purpleheart, with inlaid mother of pearl and gilt bronze. Three doors open onto the main body of the piece, which holds the drawers where the jewelry was kept.

Furniture for Josephine
This jewelry cabinet was intended for the bedchamber of the empress Joséphine (1763–1814) in the Palais des Tuileries. The bronzes conceal locks and mechanisms allowing access to the drawers and secret compartments. The secret mechanisms were changed when the cabinet was given to the empress Marie-Louise (1791–1847) in 1810. In 1812, the jewelry case was supplemented by two further pieces from the cabinetmaker François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter, which were smaller but in the same style.
A cabinet of architectural shape
Designed after a model by the architect Charles Percier (1764–1838), the cabinet has the shape of a building standing on eight vertical legs and suppported by a rectangular base. Above the cornice rises a stylobate. A cassolette for perfumes stands on the base. The legs and cornice are made of purpleheart, while the interior of the cabinet, furnished with thirty drawers of the same wood (ten in each part of the body), are neither of purpleheart nor yew, but solid mahogany.
Lavish gilt bronze decoration
The jewelry case is lavishly decorated with elements in bronze. In the center is a scene depicting the birth of the Queen of the Earth, ""to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten to bear their offerings."" Long attributed to Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843), the bronzes were probably made by the Maison Jacob-Desmalter. The model for the subject in the center was the work of the sculptor Antoine-Denis Chaudet (1763–1810), whose drawings are in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Louvre. Lastly, on each of the side doors stands a goddess turning toward the central scene. The decoration as a whole foreshadows the ornamental excess of the late nineteenth century.

The harp may have been the Egyptians' favorite musical instrument and was represented on paintings and relief sculptures as early as the Old Kingdom. The trigon appeared much later during the New Kingdom. This angular shape, with a vertical sound box, came from the East. The instrument in the Louvre is the only example of its type in such good condition.
A virtually intact antique instrument
The exceptionally well-conserved large instrument is a trigon or angle harp. It consists of a cedar sound box and a tailpiece made of maritime pine, fitted with 21 alternating light and dark dowels. One end of the strings was wound around these dowels. The other end was attached to a suspension rod into the sound box and wrapped in green leather. The top of the instrument is sealed by small piece of wood covered with a cutout leather decor featuring a phoenix amid lotus flowers. 
Unknown music
Like all Egyptian harps, this one is vertical: the musician held it upright, the wood frame against his chest, and plucked the strings with his fingers. These strings, a modern addition, were probably originally made of gut.The lack of musical notation system in Egypt and the fact that we do not know the diameter or tension of the original strings means that we cannot have an accurate idea of the type of music produced by the instrument. By working with a replica, however, we were able to deduce that it had an extensive range and a low, muffled sound.The number of notches on the suspension rod is larger than the number of dowels on the tailpiece, proof that this harp was carefully tuned.
The Egyptians' favorite instrument
The harp, the Egyptians' favorite musical instrument, was used as early as the Old Kingdom. The harp depicted on many mastabas is an arched instrument with a long curved handle and few strings. The angle harp, invented in the East during the second millennium BC, first appeared in Egypt during the New Kingdom. The two types of harps resulted in a wide variety of shapes and decoration.The instrument grew in popularity throughout the Greek-Roman period. It was used both for private purposes, where it accompanied songs and dances, as illustrated in tomb decors, and for religious purposes, to accompany prayers to the gods.

This work can be dated back to 1624-26, to the beginning of the artist's brilliant Caravaggist period when he was part of the Utrecht school. It is an allusion to the world of the theater (antique costume) and possibly an allegory of hearing or vanity (the vanities of music and pleasure). There is a copy in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum that was famous for a long time, but its reputation has now been usurped.
Actor or buffoon?
The upper half of a young man's body is set against a neutral background; he is playing the lute. Hals has placed him within a very tight frame, which makes it seem as if the figure is emerging from the picture. Thus there is a heightened impression that the lutist is moving, accentuated by the fact that his head and shoulders are twisted in the opposite direction. The character's identity is uncertain. Is he simply a musician on tour? Does he play a buffoon as his very jolly appearance might have us believe? Or is he a theatrical figure as indicated by his fantasy costume, which is both elegant and archaic (sixteenth century)? 
A genre portrait
A wide, mischievous, perhaps ironic smile lights up the whole of the lutist's face, giving it enormous life. The natural spontaneity that the picture exudes is undoubtedly due to the fact that the artist studied a real man, the same model who is found in several other of his pictures. However, this is not strictly speaking a portrait, although Hals became famous for these too. Portrait commissions were restricted to the upper classes of society-the nobility, the middle classes, or perhaps men of letters who had themselves painted in conventional, rather static poses. The portrayal of ""little people"" from the lower classes-peasants, merry drinkers, or loose women-obviously did not have the same purpose of social recognition. In fact these pictures, which belong to what are known as genre portraits, were often the means of making a moral judgement on the pleasures of the senses and their attendant dangers. Thus this lutist might well be an allegory of hearing or a lesson about the vanity of music, which by definition is ephemeral.  
The artist's Caravaggist period
This genre portrait, half realistic and half allegorical, resembles similar subjects treated by the followers of Caravaggio in Utrecht. The method of illuminating a figure by means of a strong light from the side that molds the contours and gives them relief was typical of Caravaggio's style and the movement that followed it. However, there is no evidence that the Master of Haarlem had any direct contact with artists like Hendrick Terbrugghen (1588-1629) or Gerrit van Honthorst (1590-1656). The stylistic similarity is probably explained by the vogue for this type of picture that was current throughout Europe. But Hals differs from his contemporaries, with their rather stereotyped representations, bringing great vitality to his picture. Great colorist that he is, he emphasizes the play of brightness on the blacks and reds by introducing golden highlights. The lutist, with his dynamism, heralds that lightness and freedom of touch that was to culminate with the famous Bohemian (Musée du Louvre, MI 926). The artist's Caravaggist period was short (from 1620 to around 1625) but brilliant, and it brought his work to prominence during the nineteenth century, leading him to be seen as a forerunner of Édouard Manet.

The picture was meant to be hung above a mantelpiece, hence the figures (in old-fashioned theater costume) shown on a balcony. One of Honthorst's first paintings, it is in the neo-Italian and illusionist style that would prove so successful for him. 
A joyous concert
Five women comfortably installed on a kind of stone balcony are giving a concert. Three singers are reading from sheet music while the two musicians accompanying them improvise the melody, as was customary at that time. The musician on the right is playing the lute, and the one on the left an archilute or bass lute, whose complex chords were greatly appreciated. The singers are gazing down at their scores, intently following their lyrics, while the two lute players are smiling fetchingly at the viewer. The boisterous musical exuberance of the two opulent, rosy-cheeked beauties is echoed by the picture's clear, bright colors. 
Theatrical trompe-l'oeil
Red damask curtains have been theatrically drawn to reveal the musicians. Their brightly colored clothes, which Honthorst borrowed from 16th-century Burgundian theatre as the Venetian painters had done, add to the overall gaiety. The scene is depicted very realistically in sotto, i.e seen from below. These artifices are designed to create a trompe-l'oeil opening above a fireplace. It is thought that this musicians' gallery, formerly in the stadtholder's collection, was part of a décor. The balustrade on which the lute player is sitting was probably a continuation of the mantelpiece, which would explain the upward looking viewpoint.  
""Gerrit of the Night""?
Honthorst, who was born in Utrecht, spent around ten years in Rome, where he very probably saw works by Annibale Caracci, whose Bacchus and Ariadne (Palazzo Farnese) inspired the two graceful cherubs. But he was above all influenced by the Caravaggist painters, as were his fellow countrymen Ter Brugghen and Baburen. Honthorst retained Caravaggio's predilection for working class characters in theatrical costumes portrayed from the waist up. But here he abandons the somber palette which in Italy had earned him the nickname Gherardo della Notte (Gerrit of the Night) and plays on a chromatic scale of light, bright colors, setting the tone with electric blue and pale yellow and a few striking notes of bright red. This adaptation of the Caravaggio esthetic to a Nordic spirit and a fondness for musical subjects and ample-bodied beauties is typical of the ""Utrecht Caravaggists"".

This mosaic panel, made of stone tesserae, shows a harpist. It was part of the decoration of the iwan of the ""palace"" of Shapur I at Bishapur, the new capital of the Sassanid Empire, built after the king's victories over Rome. Iranian heritage and Greco-Roman influences are combined in both the technique and the imagery (musician, interlacing, cubes).  
Shapur I: a warrior king and a builder
Shapur I (241-272), the second Sassanid king, restored the borders of the empire to where they had been in the Achaemenid Persian period, inflicting a triple defeat on the Romans. In his native province of Fars, he built a new capital that would measure up to his ambitions: Bishapur, ""Shapur's City."" The city was not laid out in the circular design inherited from the Parthians, but followed the grid (Hippodamian) plan used by the Greeks. Outside the city, Shapur decorated the sides of the Bishapur River gorge with huge historical reliefs commemorating his triple triumph over Rome. One of these reliefs, in a semicircular shape, has rows of registers with files of soldiers and horses, in a deliberate imitation of the narrative scenes on the Trajan column in Rome. At Bishapur the king also inaugurated the Sassanid imagery of the king's investiture, which would be copied by his successors: the king and the god are face to face, often on horseback, and the god - usually Ahura Mazda - is holding the royal diadem out to the sovereign. 
Sumptuous decoration
The main part of the excavations took place in the royal sector, in the east of the city. A fire altar, sometimes interpreted as a shrine to Anahita, was erected near the palace. In the center there is a cross-shaped space with eight large square exedrae decorated with 64 alcoves and covered with a dome roof. To the west lies a courtyard decorated with mosaics; to the east, a square iwan used as a reception room. Its walls must have been covered with small stucco ornaments: rows of medallions, bands of foliage, and topped with merlons inherited from Achaemenid architecture. All these decorative techniques were still used after the Islamic conquest. The floor was paved with black marble slabs, with a mosaic border. Along the walls runs a narrow band featuring a series of heads and masks, in a frontal or profile view, on a white background. At the top of each alcove there was a picture of women naked under their transparent veils: courtesans, musicians, dancers, women twisting garlands, together with a few richly attired noble ladies.   
Between East and West
When Shapur I captured Antioch, he deported skilled artists to Persia to work on his buildings. The Bishapur mosaics are clearly influenced by Roman art in Syria, and in Antioch in particular: all the geometrical motifs, like the interlacing and cubes shown in perspective, are derived from this tradition. We see Dionysian themes in the masks, the musicians, and the dancers. Yet, while the Dionysian tradition is of Greco-Roman inspiration, some details - such as the women sitting on the ground rather than on a stool or cushion - are plainly Iranian or Eastern. Lastly, the overall scheme of the decoration is less a matter of importing classical iconography than of adapting motifs celebrating a delight in wine, women, and song to the needs of the Sassanid palace. This room was used for celebrations and royal festivities, as well as banquets given for feast days such as the New Year celebration of the rebirth of nature. This harmonious combination of classical traditions and Iranian heritage marks the dawning of the Sassanid culture.

This is one of the finest examples of the free, highly pictorial penwork of Preti, one of the best Neapolitan draughtsmen of his time. It is a study for his painting The Concert, in the Doria Pamphili Gallery in Rome, a youthful work made after the artist's arrival in Rome in about 1630. The composition, which here breaks off on the right-hand side, would be more complex in the painting.
Music and society
In the nineteenth century, this drawing was considered to be of Venetian provenance. Rediscovered among the drawings by unidentified Italian artists in the Louvre collection about forty years ago, it was recognized as the work of Mattia Preti, and the connection with The Concert, in the Doria Pamphili Gallery, was made. The man sitting on the left does indeed feature in the painting, and his pensive attitude amply demonstrates the young artist's talent for psychological insight into his figures. This type of figure, with a pronounced paunch, crops up frequently in Preti's banquet scenes. The young man singing with his eyes raised heavenward, as well as the young woman at the spinet, also feature in the painted version, though the spinet-player is positioned on the other side of the table. There is more to the painting on the right-hand side, and the group of singers behind the table is larger, transforming the intimate scene depicted in the drawing into a veritable slice of social history.
The influence of Caravaggio
In about 1630, the young Mattia Preti came from Calabria, his native region, to Rome via Naples, in order to be with his brother Gregorio, who was also a painter. Shortly after arriving in Rome, he produced genre scenes and concert scenes with three or more figures and came into direct contact with the last works to be influenced by Caravaggio. These paintings, which are undeniably Caravaggesque in feeling, link Preti's work to that of other young artists, such as Valentin and Vouet, who also came under the sway of the revolutionary approaches to light and verism adopted by Caravaggio. The choice of subject and the fact that the figures are arranged with a certain refined yet expressive elegance (this can even be seen in the drawing) are evidence of Caravaggio's influence. The structure of the composition is clearly defined, but Preti shows himself to be extremely free in his rendering of detail, which he is happy to simplify, thereby achieving a highly evocative pictorial effect.
A fully developed style
Preti's stylistic vocabulary is fully formed here. Preti would subsequently continue to use the drawing style he had adopted as a young man, developing and enriching it, at least in his studies in red chalk, without modifying any of its essential characteristics: an energetic and firm stroke, a carefully studied monumental approach to composition, and contrasts of light and shade (less apparent here than in other drawings). Despite the worn state of the paper and the occasional clumsiness in the proportions of the figures (particularly in the arms), the precise and studied style of drawing and the constant use of certain contour lines look ahead to the long series of mature drawings Preti made for the cupola of the church of S. Biagio in Modena, and to the artist's masterpiece, made after a period spent in Naples, his decorative scheme for the vault of the cathedral of St. John in Valletta, Malta.

Orpheus Charming the Animals is one of a number of works in which Cades treats a subject from mythology. During the latter part of the eighteenth century, Europe was swept by a wave of interest in the revival of classical history and mythology. However, the distinctively personal approach to antiquity developed by Cades sets him apart from his contemporaries.

Orpheus, the bard of love
This drawing, dating from the 1780s, was probably the preliminary study for a decorative painting (or perhaps for an engraving) today only known to us through two unsigned drawings. The work is composed of two scenes: in the background, Orpheus charming the birds; in the foreground, a strange allegory which is rather difficult to interpret. A female figure, probably Venus, gestures toward three cupids hammering at an anvil (possibly that of Vulcan). The juxtaposition of these two scenes, with the noisy atmosphere of the one in stark contrast to the musicality of the other, probably derives from a loose and ironic interpretation of Book Ten of Ovid's Metamorphoses (8 AD) in which the Latin poet recounted Orpheus's romantic adventures. The hero, after failing in his attempt to rescue Eurydice from the underworld, retired to Thrace, where he renounced his love of women and dedicated his life to teaching. He taught the men of this part of Greece the art of loving pre-pubescent boys.
The vogue for classical antiquity
In the latter part of the eighteenth century, Europe rediscovered classical antiquity. Artists and intellectuals were enthused by new trends such as orientalism and especially Egyptomania. However, Cades developed such a personal taste for the Antique and for Renaissance painting that he soon found himself on the margins of Roman artistic circles. In his work, ancient history and myth, treated with irony, become the outward projection of an inner world informed by human passions. The serene vision of history and of antiquity which predominated among contemporary artists is transformed in Cades' work by his melancholy temperament and his dark and sorrowful experience of existence.
A sculptural effect
Cades worked on the paper for this drawing in the same manner as a sculptor chiseling the surface of stone; the drawing has the appearance of a bas-relief on a sarcophagus or of a temple pediment. The blank, almost abstract background highlights the importance of the subjects depicted. The artist vividly evokes the effect of the music which seems to affect both the animals and Orpheus' soul so profoundly. Stylistically, the drawing is a perfect example of Cades' highly finished manner, and of his method of using  curved and flowing lines. This was how he defined the solid and imposing forms which inhabit the space like sculpted figures.

These objects are curved like boomerangs; each end is decorated with the head of the goddess Hathor and a slender hand. These musical instruments are known as clappers, and they were used in pairs. The sound produced by striking these two elements together replaced hand clapping as a way of creating a rhythm for music and accompanying dances.

	Hathor, goddess of music

	The most beautiful known examples of clappers are carved from hippopotami canine teeth, as are these. The relative curve of the object is determined by the natural shape of the tooth. Other, simpler clappers in wood exist. The inside surface of this pair of clappers is flat. Both have a hole at the wider end for attaching a cord. The head of the goddess Hathor decorates the other end; viewed from the front, she is recognizable by her small cow ears; she is wearing a flat cap that extends into a main with extremely long, slender fingers and well-defined fingernails.

	A dual function

	The decoration suggests a relationship between the clappers and the cult of Hathor, the goddess of joy, love, and music. Some clappers show clear signs of wear, a proof of repetitive use. However, as is the case for many Egyptian objects, the distinction between everyday objects and ritual objects, which were heavily charged with symbols and magic, is not always easy to determine. For Egyptians, these instruments were probably far more than mere musical instruments.

	An extremely old musical instrument

	Given the lack of any archeological context, we must be cautious in dating these instruments. These clappers, shaped like curved rods, seem to be the first musical instruments to have been depicted on vases, as early in the predynastic period. Clappers with hands appeared in the Middle Kingdom, yet it seems that the most beautiful of these objects can be dated to the New Kingdom, particularly those representing a head of Hathor. Music and dance played an important role in ancient Egypt, as illustrated by the decoration of tombs and temples from the Old Kingdom on. Large numbers of the most diverse musical instruments - harps, lyres, flutes, tambourines, clappers, and sistrums - were discovered in burial vaults, but unfortunately, we do not know the sounds and rhythms they made, as the Egyptians did not have any system of musical notation.

In Mesopotamia, stone and metal were rare and costly materials. Clay, however, was abundant and easily available for all to use. It served to make all sorts of utensils, as well as human and animal figurines. Toward the end of the third millennium BC, small reliefs of stamped clay began to appear, proof of the development of a fresh, lively artistic tradition. The plaque with a harpist is one of the most refined examples of this popular art form. 
A popular art form
The invention of the single-valve or open mold towards the end of the third millennium BC meant that large numbers of small reliefs of stamped clay could be produced. These have been found in great quantities in archaeological sites throughout Mesopotamia. They were probably made in temple workshops that produced the small plaques very cheaply, much like today's devotional images. Visitors to the temple would buy them as offerings to leave in the shrine, or to take them home for their own household altar. They were also placed in sepulchers to accompany the deceased in the afterlife. These charmingly fresh, sometimes naive, plaques feature a range of subjects, including gods, worshippers making offerings, nude female forms, and embracing couples - probably used in fertility rites - as well as animals, acrobats, and, as in this case, musicians. They reflect a popular religion that was closer to the everyday lives of its believers than the official religions.  
The importance of music
In Mesopotamia, music had a vital social and religious function. It was an important part of every official ceremony, religious or otherwise. It was played at banquets. It was a vital part of the sacred chants that accompanied the daily religious devotions and the recitation of hymns and lamentations. Every palace and temple had its own professional musicians. Some cuneiform tablets giving precise details on musical techniques have been discovered, but only a tiny number of original musical instruments have survived. This means that figurative representations such as this plaque are particularly important as a source of information.
The harpist and his harp
The musician, wearing a long, draped garment, is playing a bow-shaped harp, holding the boat-shaped resonator (or sound box) under his left arm. In his right hand he holds a plectrum which he uses to pluck all the strings together, holding down the ones he does not want to sound with his left hand. This harp may be the magur, as played by Shulgi, king of the third Ur dynasty, at the end of the third millennium BC. The word ""magur"" means ""ship"", and the resonator of the harp does indeed resemble a boat. In the early years of the third millennium, many different types of harp were invented. Alongside the bow-shaped harps, which are based directly on musical bows - one of the earliest known instruments - there appeared the first angular harps, whose resonator is perpendicular to the strut the strings are attached to. These harps can be held either horizontally or vertically. This new type of harp spread to Assyria and Iran, and was still in use in a more elaborate form in seventeenth-century Turkey. We know very little about what these harps would have sounded like. Their tone must have been deep and muffled, the notes much lower than modern harps.

This painting of Saint Cecilia was probably commissioned by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi. The painting was brought to France in about 1650-1660. The composition is inspired by Raphael's Saint Cecilia, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Bologna. 
Divine music
Saint Cecilia is holding a bass viol with seven strings. The neck of the instrument is carved with the winged head of an angel. Beside the saint is an angel holding the score of a cantata to the glory of Saint Cecilia with a bass viol accompaniment. The saint is singing and playing her instrument, but she is not following the score. Her eyes are raised heavenwards in divine inspiration. The body of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music, was discovered in a miraculous state of conservation in Rome in 1599. Domenichino may have painted this work some time around 1617, shortly after his return to Bologna. He saw Raphael's Saint Cecilia (1514) in Bologna and doubtless learned the principles of Roman classicism from Raphael's example.
Mannerist beauty
The work is characterized by the remarkable stability of its composition.The three figures of the saint, the instrument, and the angel represent three imposing vertical forms. The curving lines of the instrument mirror Saint Cecilia's loose gown and the rather chubby angel. The three shapes form a diagonal line, creating a ""decrescendo"" from the background to the foreground. The vertical lines of these three forms are balanced by the horizontal lines of the bow and the marble base that the instrument is resting on, which may be a balustrade or a pedestal. The scene is lit from the left with a diffuse golden light which warms the scarlet fabric of the saint's gown. The perfect oval of the saint's face, the detailed rendition of her hairstyle and gown, and the delicacy of her hands make her a vision of the Mannerist ideal of feminine beauty. 
A scene for private devotion
Over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, Catholicism laid ever greater emphasis on the worship of the saints, following the Tridentine reform and as a riposte against protestantism. The saints were seen as intercessors between ordinary worshippers and God, and they came to represent a more personal and individual form of religious devotion. Despite the large size of this painting, it is a perfect example of a work designed to bring about a sense of intimacy in the viewer. By placing the viol rather than the saint on the pedestal base, for example, the artist underlines the role of music as an intermediary between worshippers and the realm of God. The open score is there to allow the viewer to join the saint in her heavenly singing. Domenichino aimed to revive the echoes of antique music through painting. In this work, he has created a fusion of the two arts to depict the mystic union between the saint, the Catholic viewer, and God.

The sistrum consists of a round handle and a hoop-shape that once held three metal rods fitted with bronze discs that created rattling sounds. Female temple musicians used this instrument in rites devoted to a divine cult. It features images of the goddesses Isis and Mut playing the sistrum for Amun depicted as a ram. This lavishly decorated object illustrates the power of Amun clergy, of which this singer Henuttawy.
A percussion instrument
This sistrum consists of two sections. The first is a round handle, the top of which is fashioned into the head of the goddess Hathor. Her head is framed by two cobras wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and two rows of seven cobras on the long sides, with only two on the shorter sides. The second section of the instrument consists of a bent metal hoop with three holes pierced on the each vertical section. Each pair of holes held a serpent-shaped metal rod fitted with metal discs. When it was rattled, the instrument produced a sharp, staccato-like sound, hence the onomatopoeic Egyptian word for the sistrum: ""sechech."" 
An instrument used essentially by women
The sistrum was the favorite instrument of the temple singers, or ""chantresses,"" as it was created a rhythm for the songs required by the liturgy. As this was the only role held by women in the cult (with a few exceptions), they were therefore the only ones to use the sistrum. In this case, two goddesses depicted as musicians on the hoop: ""Isis the great, mother of the god,"" on the one hand, and ""Mut the great, the Lady of Asheru [Karnak]"" on the other. They are both portrayed facing the ram of Amun, playing for his ""perfect face,"" as indicated in the hieroglyphs written in front of them.
The decorative arts for the glory of Amun-Ra in Karnak
The marvelous technical and artistic quality of this instrument illustrates the wealth and power of the Amun clergy in the early years of the Third Intermediate Period, the summit of theocratic power in Upper Egypt. At this time, the great god of Karnak governed earthly affairs directly via its high priest, then somewhat later, via his Divine Adoratrice. As for the pharaoh, he ruled in the Delta, where he was essentially instructed to mind his own business. Under the Amun clergy, the art of bronze with gold inlays reached an extraordinary degree of perfection. The sistrum of Henuttawy, a female chantress of Isis and Amun, and especially the statue of the Divine Adoratrice of  Karomama, also in the Louvre, are spectacular examples of this art.

A complex, multi-faceted artist who easily absorbed visual experience, Giordano is revealed often to have been an inspired draftsman. The composition and graphic aspects of this drawing of St. Cecilia playing the organ indicate it was completed early in Giordano's career, when he was still very much influenced by his master Jusepe de Ribera (1591-1652). HIs brilliant calligraphic style exploits all the effects possible with brown wash.
The master Ribera
Giordano was famed in his day for his skill in making the style of his illustrious masters his own, although his own touch is immediately recognizable. He tried to minimize the role of drawing, but his exceptional talent in this field shone through. The style of this early drawing, as well as that of a Martyrdom of St. Sebastian, also in the Louvre, is identical to that of a study in the Villa Farnesina in Rome for the painting Jesus among the Doctors (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome), whose date may be between 1657 and 1660. The freshness of Ribera's influence can be seen in the use of fragmented lines and in the positioning of all the figures in the same plane of perspective. Giordano brought to his drawings a sense of scale and a pictorial sensibility that are his own, which may be seen in a comparison of two refined, detailed studies in the Louvre - Moses drawing water from the rock and Samson and Delilah - with drawings by Ribera.
. . . and Rosa and Cambiaso . . .
Evoking the Neapolitan artistic ambiance of the second half of the 17th century, this drawing, as well as Giordano's Susannah and the Elders (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples), also echoes the graphic work of Salvator Rosa, particularly his Woman playing a Lute (Teylers Museum, Haarlem), in the broad, free, sweeping lines that scorn formal construction and painstaking accuracy. His style also came under the influence of the Genoese artist Luca Cambiaso. Literary sources indicate that in his youth, Giordano practiced copying Cambiaso's works. This is corroborated by a fragment of a letter dated 1687, written on the reverse of a drawing in Munich catalogued as an anonymous 17th-century work. The Genoese influence probably played an important part in helping Giordano break free from the shadow of his master Ribera; this contact, together with trips to Venice and Rome, helped Giordano develop a freer style.
Giordano the draftsman
Giordano the draftsman has a great deal in common with Giordano the painter. In both cases, he uses a wide variety of techniques, some unusual, such as the combination of pen for outlines and chalk to bulk out volumes. His drawings reveal a spontaneous temperament and are less the result of his research than the reflection of his impressions, thrown down vigorously on the page. He worked in several styles at a time and often returned to previous styles to give them another try. In the 1670s, his figures seemed to melt into their surroundings, which were filled with a new light. In both drawing and painting, he developed a more personal style from around 1680, which set him apart from other artists of the late 17th century. His art became more consistent: no drawings from this later period show the least sign of mediocrity or weakness.

The stele of music shows the foundation rites - performed to the sound of the lyre - of the temple built by Prince Gudea (c. 2100 BC) at his capital of Telloh (ancient Girsu), for Ningirsu, god of the state of Lagash in the Land of Sumer. The stele thus accords with the tradition of Neo-Sumerian art, which unlike that of the preceding period that focused on the warlike exploits of the rulers of Akkad, tends to show the king engaged in pious activities.
The building of Ningirsu's temple
In the Neo-Sumerian Period (c. 2100 BC), the rulers Gudea and Ur-Nammu had themselves depicted taking part in the foundation rites of temples, notably on steles, as statues, and as figurines. On the stele of music, Gudea, carrying a peg and cord and followed by figures probably representing his princely heir and two priests, prepares to lay out the plan of Ningirsu's sanctuary. The ceremony is punctuated by music, which accompanies the chanting or singing of liturgical poems. Behind the cantor, a musician plays on a lyre whose sound box is decorated with a bull. The deep tones of the instrument evoked the bellowing of a bull, and by poetic identification, within the temple of Ningirsu ""the room of the lyre was a noisily breathing bull."" The making of the god's lyre gave its name to the third year of Gudea's reign, called ""the year in which was made the lyre [called] Ushumgalkalamma [the dragon of the land of Sumer].""
Music in temple foundation ceremonies
The spirit embodied by the lyre played a part in the events leading to the building of the temple, for it appears in the dream in which the god reveals to Gudea the task he is to accomplish (Gudea Cylinders, Louvre, MNB 1512 and MNB 1511): ""When, together with Ushumgalkalamma, his well-beloved lyre, that renowned instrument, his counselor, you bring him gifts [...] the heart of Ningirsu will be appeased, he will reveal the plans of his temple.""When the work was complete, Ushumgalkalamma went before Gudea, leading all the musical instruments, to mark the arrival of the god in his new abode. Ushumgalkalamma is the god's counselor because its song calms the emotions that disturb the spirit, allowing the return of the reason indispensable to good judgement. Among the divine servants of Ningirsu, it is the lyre's duty to charm his master, a god of changeable mood. It is assisted by the spirit of another lyre that brings consolation in times of darkness: ""So that the sweet-toned tigi-drum should play, so that the instruments algar and miritum should resound for Ningirsu, [...] his beloved musician Ushumgalkalamma accomplished his duties to the lord Ningirsu. To soothe the heart and calm the liver [the seat of thought], to dry the tears of weeping eyes, to banish grief from the grieving heart, to cast away the sadness in the heart of the god that rises like the waves of the sea, spreads wide like the Euphrates, and drowns like the flood of the storm, his lyre Lugaligihush accomplished his duties to his lord Ningirsu.""
Representations of musicians in Mesopotamia
Representations of musicians are not uncommon in Near-Eastern iconography. They are found from the early 3rd millennium BC in the banquet scenes that appear on perforated plaques and cylinder seals. Early in the next millennium, they would appear on molded terracotta plaques, such as the example with the harpist in the Louvre (AO 12454). Very few examples of musical instruments have survived until today (among them the lyres from the royal tombs of Ur, c. 2550 BC); these representations are therefore particularly valuable.

A delicate musical scene, which plays on the symbolism of musical and emotional harmony.
A concert
The scene takes place in a comfortable bourgeois interior. A rich tapestry hangs in the background, and the table is covered by a luxurious oriental carpet with the kind of colorful, geometric design that appealed to northern painters. The two young women are giving a little concert: the one on the left is playing a theorbo; her companion, who is seated, is following the score, beating time, and no doubt preparing to sing. A young servant has brought a glass of beer on a tray. Ter Borch reused (and refined) the genre scenes that were in vogue a few years earlier through the influence of painters such as Pieter Jacobsz. Codde.
The poetry of silence
The sober setting draws attention to the characters, who seem to be in a safe and cozy world of their own. The singer's bright dress and the scarlet of the chair are like high notes in this scene, painted in a palette of rather discreet grays and browns. Ter Borch paid great attention to the rendering of fabrics, and created a truly admirable effect here with the white and gray harmony of the skirt and pale yellow of the bodice. The subtlety of the chromatic scale is like a painted echo to the music. Besides these graceful and sophisticated scenes, Ter Borch painted even more intimist works such as the tender Reading Lesson (in the Louvre). This ""poetry of silence"" recalls the calm compositions of Vermeer. Indeed, in later life, Ter Borch was not insensitive to the art of the Delft master.
An elegant reflection of the bourgeoisie
From 1654, Ter Borch concentrated almost exclusively on refined paintings of this kind and on portraits of wealthy bourgeois, painting military subjects only rarely. These charming interior scenes (many of which have romantic connotations) were very popular with the Dutch bourgeoisie, who appreciated Ter Borch's elegant portrayal of their class. The painter multiplied these ""fashionable subjects"", often reusing favorite motifs such as the carpet on the tablecloth or the singer's rather graceless profile (so characteristic of his female figures). French art lovers of the 18th century were also avid collectors of his work, sensitive as they were to his taste for pleasant, poetic scenes.

This young woman playing a theorbo is an allegory of music, just as the companion piece The Indifferent Man is an allegory of dance. Music and dance are key elements of Watteau's artistic vision.
A fantasy figure
This painting is a fine example of Watteau's graceful approach to subjects that lend themselves to refined effects of technique and texture. Here, the young woman is painted as an impersonal, fantasy figure. She may be intended as an allegory of music.

This small, brightly colored wooden stele, a testimony of individual piety, is typical of the Third Intermediate Period. The scene portraying the deceased in front of a deity is traditional, but the originality of the stele resides in the fact that the usual image of the deceased, standing with raised arms, was replaced by that of a harpist. 
An original sun worshiper
This small, arched stele is made of stuccoed and painted wood. The single decorated side depicts a harpist worshiping the sun. The scene is framed by a visual overview of the universe. The rounded sign for the sky along the arch is painted blue. ""Was"" scepters on each side support this sign. A thin horizontal strip below the figures represents the earth. A series of protective symbols are placed under the arch: two wedjat eyes frame a shen ring over a stream of water and a small vase. In this scene, the adororation is not depicted by the deceased raising his arms to a god, but rather by a kneeling harpist, his mouth open as he recites his hymn. The musician is clad in pleated linen. He is accompanying himself on an angle harp, decorated with the head of a pharaoh. Opposite, the falcon-headed god Ra-Horakhty is seated on a throne placed on a platform. He is wrapped in a mummy-shaped sheath and wears the sun disk crown adorned with a uraeus and. He holds the flail and crook scepters in his hands. The two figures are separated by an offering consisting of an ewer and basin, and a lotus flower.
The legend
A six-column hieroglyph, painted against a yellow background, is placed above the figures. The column on the far left refers to Ra- Horakhty and reveals the identity of the god: ""Ra-Horakhty, the great god, lord of the sky."" The other five columns refer to the harpist. They contain the start of a hymn to the sun: ""Adore Ra when he rises,"" followed by the title and name of the harpist: ""the singer of Amun, lord of the thrones of the Two Lands [Egypt], who resides in Thebes, Djedkhonsuiuefank"" as well as an offering formula.
Nature and provenance
A large number of private steles, dispersed among various museums, are similar to tis stele in the Louvre. These small monuments are made of stuccoed and brightly painted wood, and are decorated with a scene presenting a deceased facing a deity, generally a solar god, and sometimes Osiris.These steles come from the region of Thebes, and most were made during the Third Intermediate Period. They were designed for tombs, and a few of these objects were discovered in burial vaults.

The Camel Clock has been exhibited in the Salon d'Abondant since 1998. A camel crouching on a four-legged plinth supports the mechanism and face of the clock. The clock face has wings and Rococo curves on either side of it, and above the dial is an Indian holding a parasol. The movement is by the clockmaker Brindeau. The clock is stamped with a C topped by a crown, a hallmark used on all such works in metal between 1747 and 1749, which confirms the date.
Clocks with animal themes
Clocks with animal themes include figures of rhinoceroses, elephants, lions, horses, wild boar, and dragons. The figure of a camel is relatively rare.
The European taste for the exotic
The Indian figure, known as a mahout or elephant-driver, is wearing a hat with feathers, but his costume is inauthentic, not matching the clothes that would have been worn by such a person. He is designed in counterpoint to the camel, facing left to look at the animal, which is turning to the right. Under Louis XV, the taste for the exotic was often expressed by using ""Chinese"" or ""Indian"" figures, especially on clocks.
A very imaginative art work in bronze
The design of this clock is particularly imaginative. The camel really seems to be holding up the clockface and trying to raise it. The sense that the animal is beginning to move, and the gesture of the Indian towards it, prevent the composition from being static. Nor do we have the impression that the decoration has been superimposed onto the body of the clock in an artificial way. The entire design is quite successful because all of the elements are in harmony.

This haughty and elegant seated cat is one of many ex-votoes from the Late Period (664-332 BC); these objects were placed in the temples to Bastet to honor the goddess and earn her protection for the donor. Admire the brilliant workmanship of the Saite bronzesmith; the pure lines and extremely smooth finish on this sculpture endow this small domestic animal with the dignity of the goddess, daughter of the sun, and patron saint of the home.

A sacred animal
The goddess Bastet is depicted here in her animal form. She has inlaid colored glass eyes, and is seated in a sophisticated and hieratic pose. Its front paws are long and straight, while the tail creates a flexible line enclosing the body. The elegant shapes, lines, and planes confer dignity and strength to this work. The cat is wearing a necklace of cylindrical beads and a breastplate pendant decorated with the head of a feline crowned with a sun disk. The image of a scarab is engraved in its head.
Bastet
Originally, Bastet was a lioness goddess linked to the solar god, and as such, embodied its destructive power. Then in the early first millennium BC, she also became goddess of fertility and protector of the home, in the gentler feline form of the cat. From this period on, statuettes and figurines made of various materials depicted her as an attentive mother cat, with her kittens nursing or playing all around her. Her cult expanded further when her town in the Delta, Bubastis (from per Bastet, which means ""house of Bastet), became the primary royal residence of the kings of the 22nd Dynasty, during the 10th century BC.A lavish festival was held annually in this city in her honor, to celebrate the return of the Nile floodwaters. Herodotus, who attended the event, explained that the many worshipers consumed ""more wine than during the rest of the year."" Throughout the first millennium BC, she was honored throughout Egypt, particularly in Memphis. Countless bronze ex-voto figures have been found on all the sites where worshippers expressed their veneration.
An accurately dated offering
This is one of the most accurately dated metal objects from the Late Period. Two inscriptions with the cartouches of King Psammetichus I, the first pharaoh of the 26th Dynasty, are engraved around the edge of the base, which reproduces the counterweight of the sacred necklace (the menat) of the goddesses Hathor, Isis, and Bastet.The text tells us that a certain Mersopdu, son of Hor, made an offering to Bastet to obtain the protection of the goddess. It also notes that the object was placed in the temple under the responsibility of Djedbastetioufankh, a priest-dancer for the goddess.

This medallion made up the center of the great carpet in the throne room at the Palais des Tuileries. Delivered in 1810  for the marriage ceremony of Napoleon I and Marie-Louise, it is decorated with the symbols of the Empire. The decoration fell into disfavor under the Restoration, and the carpet was cut up. The medallion in the Louvre gives some clue to what the original carpet must have looked like.
The carpet in the Throne Room of the Palais des Tuileries
The medallion bearing the imperial coat of arms comes from a carpet that was initially intended for the hall of the State Council in the Palais des Tuileries. Woven at the Manufactory of the Savonnerie, after designs by a pupil of the architect Charles Percier (1764-1838), Debret, the carpet was delivered in 1810 to the throne room in the palace for the marriage ceremony of Napoleon I and Marie-Louise de Habsbourg-Lorraine. The throne room was entirely fitted out by Percier himself. The carpet was woven at the Manufactory following a large-scale model painted by Jacques Barraband (1767-1809). The central part was composed concentrically around the imperial coat of arms, which were encircled by a laurel wreath. In the central part could be found horns of plenty with the attributes of War, Justice, the Navy, and the Arts, framed by eagles with spread wings in the corners. On either side were two identical areas, the centers of which were marked with the letter N, and the background covered with foliage, crowned flowers, and lightning bolts.
Hunting down Imperial Emblems
After 1815, following the Bourbons' return to power, many objects were transformed to remove the symbols of the Empire (eagles, lightning bolts, bees). For this reason, the medallion of the cental section was separated from the carpet. The rest of the central section was sent to the château de Fontainebleau in 1857 (where it remains to this day), and a rewoven side section (given to the king of Saxony in 1809) is today in the château de Malmaison. The medallion in the Louvre presents an eagle with its wings spread, holding bolts of lightning in its talons and set against a sky-blue ground. It is surmounted by an imperial crown and encircled with the collar and cross of the Legion of Honor. All around this motif is a wide purple band separating it from the laurel wreath. This great imperial coat of arms was reproduced in all the royal palaces and on many works as a sign of imperial might.

This bronze cockerel is an example of the many ex-voto offerings with animal themes produced in Roman Gaul. It was probably set in a shrine at Lugdunum, now the city of Lyons, and is likely to have been made in the second century, possibly appearing together with an image of the god Mercury. The sculptor has combined Gallic decorative taste with classical realism to create a masterpiece of craftsmanship, remarkable for its minute observation of the bird's movement and posture.
A cockerel as votive offering
This large bronze cockerel was discovered in the river Saône at Lyons, ancient Lugdunum. It was probably made in this region of Roman Gaul in the second century AD. The statuette had a votive function: it will have been placed in a shrine as an object of worship, either because of the powers attributed to it or because of the deity with which the bird was associated. In this instance, it may have accompanied a large effigy of the god Mercury, since the winged creature which is generally dedicated to this god appears beside him on several Gallo-Roman works of art. In fact, there were many representations of the bird in the art of the period, as the Romans loved the pun on the word ""gallus"", which in Latin means both ""cock"" and ""Gaul"".
A combination of classical realism and Gallo-Roman taste in decoration
This bronze was made using the lost-wax technique and combines elements inspired by classical realism with Gallic taste in decoration to great effect. The work is the result of scrupulous attention to detail and close observation of the movements and posture of this feathered creature, which is shown walking along with its right foot thrust out in front. A masterpiece of modeling, the cockerel also reflects the Gallo-Roman taste for purely ornamental rendering of the subject depicted. The arrangement of the feathers, the minutely detailed incisions, and the naturalistic precision achieved by the artist bear witness to a liking for decoration in its own right.  
Roman bronzes with animal themes
Roman and Gallo-Roman art depicting animal themes flourished during the imperial period. Bronze-casters produced an abundance of small works intended as ex-voto offerings, as well as statuettes, all designed to decorate private homes. In addition to figures linked to deities and ornamental motifs, their work featured a wide range of animals; lions, bulls, horses, stags, bears, and different varieties of birds (particularly eagles and cockerels) were all part of the craftsman's stock-in-trade. So were mythological creatures, like sphinxes and griffins. As the inheritors of the Greek and Etruscan traditions, the Romans often drew much of their inspiration from Greek models.

This tapestry depicting an elephant in an exotic landscape was woven at a carpet factory in Aubusson established by Alexis Sallandrouze, cousin of the better-known Charles-Jean Sallandrouze de Lamornaix (1808-67). The design, attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Amédée Couder (1797-1864), draws on a number of different sources. By introducing these exotic influences, the tapestry contributed to a revival of the decorative arts in France in the 1840s.
A vision of Asia
The luxuriant landscape is framed by pairs of twisted columns supporting an ogee arch. The ornamental border is very rich, composed of a dense, complex tracery recalling the decorative vocabulary of Islamic architecture. Above, on either side, two niches holding vases of flowers are revealed behind upraised blinds. Beyond this architectural frame lies a luminous landscape in which an Asian elephant can be seen passing between a palm and a banana tree. The elephant, richly caparisoned from top to toe, bears a howdah in which a woman in oriental dress carrying a feather fan reclines. A peacock in the lush vegetation observes the elephant, while a monkey tries to hide in the left-hand niche to escape from a macaw. The animals and birds are all references to the continent of Asia. The tapestry may have been part of a set representing the continents.
The makers
Woven using the Aubusson technique at the factory set up by Alexis Sallandrouze in 1838, this tapestry reflects the considerable skill of the workshop that produced it. Sallandrouze, who also had an establishment in Paris, based his business on carpets designed by his colleagues. He won a bronze medal at the Industrial Exhibition of 1839 and further awards at later exhibitions. Jean-Baptiste-Amédée Couder (1797-1864) ran an enormous industrial design practice and collaborated with Sallandrouze on a number of occasions. It may have been he who  provided the design for the Elephant Tapestry. Couder was indeed fascinated by Islamic art and design, especially carpets and Persian miniatures; among his works are the so-called Nou-Rouz shawl and the Virgin Forest carpet, both imbued with the exotic.
Sources of inspiration
Islamic art has already been discussed as a source for this tapestry. That influence is mainly seen in the border, the stars, and the tracery. The Elephant Tapestry also recalls the Indies Tapestry woven at the Gobelins manufactory in the early eighteenth century, from which the Louvre has a piece called The Light-Bay Horse, in which an elephant also makes an appearance. In its overall composition, ""Asia"" recalls the Royal Houses Tapestry, also made at Gobelins. Like Couder's work in general, the Elephant Tapestry, remarked upon by Théophile Gauthier at the 1844 industrial exhibition, contributed to a stylistic renewal in the decorative arts, textiles in particular, with its introduction of exotic themes and ornament.

153,Animals,Fountain of Diana,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/fountain-diana?selection=44888,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-fontaine-diane.jpg?1527825087,"
Accompanied by her two dogs, a greyhound and a water spaniel, Diana, the goddess of hunting, reclines with her arm around a majestic stag. This sculpture once surmounted a monumental fountain on the grounds of the Château of Anet, built by Philibert de L'Orme for Diane de Poitiers, Henry II's mistress. The elongated, naked silhouette of the chaste goddess, whose beauty had always been admired, became a symbol of the French Renaissance.
Diana and the Nymph
The semi-reclining figure of Diana is seen with one arm around the neck of a stag proudly holding up its head. She is accompanied by her dogs, Phrocyon and Cyrius, clearly depicted as a greyhound and a water spaniel. She is not wearing her usual attribute, the crescent moon. This figure of Diana instantly recalls the Nymph of Fontainebleau (Louvre), a high relief sculpted by Benvenuto Cellini for Francis I. Philibert de L'Orme had installed it above the main entrance to the Château of Anet in the mid-16th century, transforming the nymph into Diana, the goddess of hunting.Without being an actual portrait of the royal favorite, the figure is certainly evocative of Diane de Poitiers, mistress of the castle. The painting of Diana the Huntress (Louvre) by a School of Fontainebleau artist likewise draws parallels between the two Dianas, and the goddess is similarly depicted nude. In the Nymph relief, Cellini had specified that the stag represented Francis I. It is tempting to think that the stag here symbolizes Henry II, Diane de Poitier's royal lover.
The sculptor
The artist to whom French sculpture owes its first large-scale nude remains an enigma. The beauty of the work presupposes a great master, but which one? Its traditional attribution to Jean Goujon (not accepted today) dates back to the French Revolution and was put forward by Alexandre Lenoir, founder of the Musée des Monuments Français and an enthusiastic admirer of Goujon. Since then, the sculpture has been attributed, in turn, to Benvenuto Cellini, Germain Pilon, Pierre Bontemps, and Ponce Jacquiot. But it is hard to judge, for the statue was heavily restored in the 18th century, and then again in 1799-1800 by the sculptor Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet, also known for his interpretation of Susannah and the Elders (1813, Louvre).
Fontainebleau elegance
Whoever the sculptor of the work was, Diana epitomizes the regal elegance of School of Fontainebleau art: the elongated Mannerist figure, the litheness of the body, the tiny high breasts, the small head, the extremely refined hairstyle, and the well-drawn eyes. A certain sensuality stems from the contrast between the nakedness of the body and the elaborateness of the hairstyle, but the ideal beauty of the figure and the purity of the lines confer a chaste distinction upon the goddess.The work is a masterpiece of harmony. To balance the goddess's pose and the majestic presence of the stag with tall antlers, which draw the group to the left, the sculptor raised the goddess' left arm and placed a bow in her hand. The heads of Diana and the stag, turned in the same direction, ensure the coherence of the scene.

This 5.7-ton block formed part of the base of one of the obelisks of the temple at Luxor: it comes from the back of the one that remains there, whose twin is on the Place de la Concorde in Paris. On their arrival in Paris, the Louvre's baboons, standing on their hind legs and lifting their arms to honor the sun, caused a scandal that seems somewhat amusing today.
Shameless creatures
Brought to France at the same time as the obelisk that originally stood on the right of the entrance to the Luxor temple, they were intended to adorn its base when it was re-erected on the Place de la Concorde. In the characteristically puritanical climate of Louis-Philip's reign, however, it was thought impossible to show such manifestly male baboons in a public place, visible to passers-by. So they were sent to the Louvre, which had no hesitation in exhibiting them.
Sun-worshippers
The animals were in fact honoring the sun. The obelisk is the most slender form of an extremely ancient Egyptian symbol, the ""ben-ben,"" which stands for the primeval mound of earth that emerged from the original chaos as the world was created by the sun. In front of the pylon at Luxor, the two obelisks stood on monolithic cubes that rested in turn on a pedestal. The front and back of the cubes were sculpted, or bore sculpted plaques, with figures similar to these. The Egyptian texts, and more particularly the hymns to the sun, make the meaning of the scene clear: the baboons are raising their hands, singing, and dancing in homage to the rising sun, which they guide and assist in its passage through the gates of day.
The baboons of Ramesses II
Each of the baboons has as a pectoral the birth or coronation name(alternately) of Ramesses II. The king seems to have been fond of thisbaboon motif, which during his reign was also used, sculpted in theround or in very high relief, on the sun altar and crowning the facadeof the temple of Abu Simbel. According to one hypothesis, it also wasfeatured on the base of two obelisks erected east of the Temple ofKarnak. The baboons' adoration of the sun had come to be given specialprominence by the time of Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) atthe latest.

The artists of the Achaemenian period inherited a pictorial vocabulary rich in mythological creatures. The griffin-lion, often represented at Susa, is here pictured on an element of architectural decoration from the palace of King Darius I the Great (522-486 BC). It featured here alongside the lion and the winged bull passant on reliefs made with bricks, with or without colors.
A decorative motif
The Frieze of Griffins is a reconstruction made with molded siliceous bricks coated in colored glazes, which had been reused in later constructions. During the excavations led by Jacques de Morgan at the Palace of Darius between 1908 and 1913 at Susa, thousands of these bricks and wall elements featuring animals and mythological creatures passant, lions, bulls and winged griffins were found. The bricks lined the walls as an architectural decor, and were charged with a symbolism relating to the Persian empire.
A composite animal
Set against a light-blue background, the white griffin passes toward the left under a frieze of palmettes. It has a lion's head, the ears of a bull, a roaring mouth and two curved goat horns, one pointing forward and the other backward. It has the body of a bull, the forelegs of a lion and hindlegs like the legs of an eagle, and its long tail is curled up into itself. The wings join the body at the top of the forelegs. Its breast and neck are covered with little curls that also run over the top of the back. The details of the animal are highlighted with a polychromy of yellow, blue and green.
An ancient tradition
The fabulous griffin figure evolved out of a long pictorial tradition of fantastic animals. On the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, there is a depiction of the Mushhushshu, a long-necked quadruped with the head and scaly body of a snake. This was the emblem of Marduk, war god and protector of the city. The griffin was a Susian creation of the late 4th millennium that became widespread, in many forms. An accounting tablet, for example, bears the mark of a cylinder seal showing a winged griffin followed by an antelope (Louvre Museum, sb4837). Many images of the griffin have been been found dating from the Neo-Elamite period, including one in bricks, shown passing before a tree, used as an element of architectural decoration (Louvre Museum, sb3370). Griffins facing each other also feature on the walls of the palace at Persepolis, built by Darius I, like the palace at Susa. The meaning of this imaginary animal remains unclear: it may refer to ancient Elamite religions and as such may represent an area of the Persian empire.

This lion, which looks like a large cat at rest, does not comply with the usual image we hold of the fearsome Egyptian sphinx. This unusual sculpture, created under the reign of Amenophis III circa 1400-1350 BC, is best known through statues from the fourth century BC or later. The Louvre's lion, which comes from the Serapeum of Saqqara, forms a pair with a symmetrical lion that once greeted visitors at the first pylon of the temple.
An Agreeable Lion
The lion is reclining, its hindquarters slumped to its right side, and its tail curled around toward the front of the body. The front right paw is turned upright, with the pads facing upward, while the left paw is crossed over the right. The rear paws are also crossed. The animal's raised head is turned to the left, while its eyes (still with traces of dark paint) stare at visitors approaching the monument. The overall pose is a naturalistic depiction of a feline at rest and relaxed, but nevertheless alert.
An Unusual Pose
This original image of a lion first appeared as a colossal work (slightly more than two meters long) at Soleb in Nubia, in the jubilee temple of Amenophis III. A tiny reclining lion, in the same position though with its tongue sticking out, also decorates the cover of an alabaster unguent recipient that belonged to Tutankhamen. This particular representation was used again only much later, probably not before the Thirtieth Dynasty, on two symmetrical pieces with the name of Nectanebo I, made of granodiorite; the origin is unknown. They were found in Rome, where they had already been taken by the twelfth century AD. Identical lions supposedly lined the dromos (processional way) leading to the Behbeit el-Haggar Temple in the Delta. The four other limestone animals discovered in Saqqara - three of which are in the Louvre - are extremely similar to those of Nectanebo. Totally anepigraphic, they probably date from the renovation of the Serapeum undertaken by the kings of the Thirtieth Dynasty.

This benevolent-looking hippopotamus slips into the marshes, taking on their colour and half-engulfed in water plants. Bright-blue Egyptian faience figures of hippopotami such as this were placed in the tombs of high-ranking civil servants toward the end of the Middle Kingdom.
A symbol
This bright-blue Egyptian faience hippopotamus, depicted ambling along, seems to slip into the water amids the water plants that form its decoration. Its excellent condition and large size make this an outstanding example of its kind: some fifty faience hippopotami, varying in size from 9 to 23 centimeters in length, are now scattered around the world. The calm, benign appearance of the hippopotamus has gained it such popularity that this blue figurine now conjures up the world of ancient Egypt and the Nile in our collective imagination.
A fresh appraisal
The story of this hippopotamus, which has been famous and popular for many years, has now been traced. In the late nineteenth century the egyptologists of the Cairo Museum, wanting duplicates of the finest works in their collection to be put on display in France, sold the hippopotamus to the Louvre. Yet this figurine has a unique feature: the four legs are connected by a strip of faience and rest on a plinth, making it the only one of its kind. Following archive research and a technical study the plinth was removed, as it did not belong to the original work and gave it the appearance of a modern ornament. We also know from its archeological context that it dates from the Seventeenth Dynasty, in the late Second Intermediate Period.
An object for the afterlife
The hippopotamus was buried in a tomb with funerary furniture comprising a coffin, statues of the deceased, a large number of vases, and a few toiletry items. It therefore served a function in the inner chamber of the tomb. The painted motifs varied from one hippopotamus to another, with water plants sometimes being combined with butterflies and birds, but the decoration of the hindquarters almost always consisted of a lotus flower in full bloom. Depicted half-submerged, the hippopotamus evokes the primordial waters of chaos, the Nun. According to an Egyptian creation myth, on the first morning after the birth of the world, the sun emerged from a lotus flower: ""Every being is born from the Nun."" The function of this hippopotamus statuette, placed near the mummy, was therefore to prefigure rebirth in the afterlife through the power of imitation.

An impressive figure of a wild roaring lion pins a serpent to the ground. Head thrown back, jaws wide open, the reptile hisses back defiantly. Owing to the extremely naturalistic rendering of both animals and the violence of the struggle depicted, this sculpture caused a huge controversy. The public and the Romantics acclaimed it. Conservative critics lamented the fact that the Tuileries Gardens, the sculpture's future home, would be turned into a zoo.
True to life
Barye sculpted animals in an unprecedented manner. First, they were the actual subject of his sculpture, and not simply accessories. Secondly, his interpretation was based on an exact and faithful analysis of nature. He sought to convey an illusion of fur, lifelike movements, and the untamed character of the animals. The lion has real substance; one can feel the muscles rippling under his pelt. Alongside the painter Delacroix, Barye spent hours on end studying, drawing, and even dissecting animals in the Jardin des Plantes. But the sculptor was no slave to his scientific knowledge: he recreated nature with the means of his art. He was occasionally compelled to exaggerate a muscle, highlight the modeling, and emphasize a line in order to give a true impression of life.
Epic inspiration
Barye instilled an epic dimension into this fight. He captured the moment when the action seems suspended in time. A dramatic element is added as the two animals size up each other's chances, anticipating the frenetic struggle to follow. Although the lion has the advantage, he remains vigilant, as can be seen from the way he spreads his claws, the position of his tail, and his bristling mane. The tension is at its peak. The snake, whose coiled head is thrown back, jaws wide open, is ready to strike at the lion's face. The lion's concentrated energy is set to respond: with puckered muzzle, furious eye, and forepaw forcefully pinning the reptile to the ground, his body is pure muscle. Both animals possess the power of life and death, which could not fail to fascinate the Romantics. The size of the sculpture heightens its impact.
Monarchist symbolism
The lion is the supreme example of a monarchic animal, a symbol of force and courage. This sculpture is thus also a tribute to the July Monarchy and King Louis-Philippe, at a time when there was widespread discontent with the regime established after the July Revolution (1830). The king's accession to the throne had taken place under the constellations of Leo (the lion) and Hydra (the sea serpent). The sculpture therefore symbolized celestial approval of this political change.

This little red limestone monkey dates from the late 3rd millennium BC. The animal appears to be an Asian macaque. Few depictions of it have been found at Susa. This statuette indicates the existence of commercial and cultural exchanges with the Indus Valley and Central Asia, where many representations of monkeys have been found.
A small monkey dating from the Bronze Age
This little red limestone monkey sitting on its hindquarters, with its back legs drawn up to its belly and its hands on its knees, was found at Susa and dates from the late 3rd millennium BC. It may depict a common Asian macaque. Its eyes are round and hollow, indicating that they may have been inlaid. The animal's tail forms a curved line at the back.
The monkey - an animal rarely depicted at Susa
This is one of the rare ancient representations of this animal found at Susa. Another monkey, already with an almost human air about it, was found in one of the two ""Archaic depots"" dating from the Uruk period, consisting in a group of small alabaster statuettes of praying figures and animals (birds, a bear, and a pig). These objects reflected the style of sculpture in this period in Mesopotamia. A number of copper cosmetic flasks from Bactria (present-day Afghanistan) dating from the late 3rd or early 2nd millennium BC also represent monkeys and mythical animals, half-monkey half-human.  Depictions of monkeys squatting and sitting on stools like humans are also to be found on metal seals from the same region.
An animal perhaps from the Indus Valley
Rarely depicted in the Susian region, the monkey was a common motif in many areas of Eastern Asia (including the Indus civilization, notably in the Harappa region), and the Mediterranean Basin (in Egypt, for example). This monkey may be an indication of the relations maintained by Susa with the Indus Valley and the regions of Central Asia (Afghanistan).

This fragment of an Old Kingdom mastaba includes a total of ten fish, all clearly identifiable and depicted with careful attention to detail, together with a frog, a hippopotamus, and a crocodile. The scene depicts the natural environment of the Nile marshes, a source of both recreation and sustenance for the tomb's noble occupant, during his life. 
A detail from a larger scene
This fragment comes from the wall of a funerary chapel, one of the mastabas (or superstructures) that surmounted the sepulchers of prominent figures during the Old Kingdom. The principal figure - the owner of the tomb - is lost apart from his left foot, standing in the bow of a small boat. The boat 'floats' on a line in horizontal relief, representing the water-line, above and below which finely-painted vertical waves indicate the waters of the Nile, full of fish. A variety of Nile algae, known as Potamogeton lucens, emerges above the surface, with a tiny blue frog seated among its fronds.The vertical representation of the river surface, around the central figure, has enabled the artist to depict his hero in a proud, upright stance, harpooning the fish horizontally, with no need to stoop towards the water. The upper section of the scene has been lost; all that remains is a small harpoon, probably held by a secondary figure. 
A densely-figured fragment
The artist uses the low relief technique to differentiate between the underwater and surface features of the scene. Figures and motifs on or near the surface are carved in low relief and painted; fauna beneath the water are rendered with paint alone, except for the hippopotami and the crocodile, whose contours are lightly incised. Modern viewers may be surprised by the disregard for scale in the depiction of the various figures. The harpooner's foot is disproportionately large, and the fish are as large as the hippopotami and the crocodile. Ancient Egyptian art does not seek to provide a visually-accurate depiction of a coherent scene; it should be ""read"" as a kind of pictorial notation, juxtaposing the objects observed. The central message in this work is the depiction of the fauna, the center of the action. In this context, the scene provides an accurate and exceptionally well-preserved illustration of the natural history of the Nile marshes.The animals depicted are, from left to right, a Mormyrus (recognisable by its trunk-like snout), a catfish, two hippopotami and a mullet. In front of the crocodile are a Citherinus latus, a Malopterurus electricus, and a Nile perch. Above the boat, from left to right: a Tetrodon fahaka, a second Mormyrus, an eel, a Synodontis batensoda, and a Tilapia nilotica.
The Nile marshes: a richly-symbolic world
To the ancient Egyptians, who made the transition from a nomadic to a settled existence as farmers in the Nile Valley, the residual marshes were the waterland from which life sprang when the world was created. They were also an important source of sustenance: the habitat of the fish that were a staple food. For high-ranking civil servants, fishing and hunting were also highly-prized leisure activities in the cool, restful marsh environment. Images such as this reproduce the typology of official scenes showing the Pharaoh engaged in similar activities - a personification of Egyptian mastery over the natural world. In the context of a mastaba, scenes such as this are intended to represent a source of life and renewal.

Mostly discovered before the technical means were available to conserve them, few ancient oriental mural paintings have survived. This little goat, which was part of a frieze, is one of the rare examples of the painted decoration of Assyrian palaces.
A premature discovery
During excavations carried out in 1929-31 at Tell Ahmar - formerly Til Barsip - on the left bank of the Euphrates some 20 kilometers south of the Turkish border, the archaeological expedition of the Louvre led by François Thureau-Dangin discovered an outstanding set of mural paintings from the Neo-Assyrian period. Unfortunately, at the time of the discovery, the archaeologists lacked the technical means to conserve the fragile paintings. Only a few fragments could be saved; they were detached from the wall and shared between the Aleppo Museum and the Louvre. However, a complete color survey was first made by the architect Lucien Cavro on rolls of paper now in the Louvre; they provide valuable documentation on the painted decoration of Assyrian palaces. 
Part of an Assyrian decoration
This palace was built some time after the conquest of the ancient Aramean city of Til Barsip by the Assyrian king Salmanasar III in 855 BC. The painted decor dating from the 8th century BC complemented or replaced the stone reliefs used in the big capitals. The decor is made up of large narrative compositions exalting the glory of the king and the power of the empire, as well as simple ornamental friezes. This fragment of painting, traditionally known as ""the blue goat"" - but more probably a wild male goat - was part of a frieze that decorated a corridor opening on to the audience hall. The frieze was made up of repeated groups of two ibexes in confrontation on either side of a decorative motif, in true oriental style. There is a striking contrast between the accurate observation of the animal and the symbolic nature of the blue color. 
A recently-identified pictorial technique
The three paintings exhibited in the Louvre were restored in 1986-87. Studies carried out at the time of restoration revealed the composition of the pigments. The blue is an ""Egyptian blue"" made from a double silicate of calcium and copper, intended to imitate lapis lazuli. The outlines are drawn in carbon black of animal or vegetable origin; the red is a natural ochre based on iron oxide. The colors were laid on the bare clay, lightly prepared with whitewash.

These decorative panels of polychrome glazed brick come from the palace of Darius I at Susa. On a blue-green ground, a pair of winged lions with bearded human heads sit facing each other, their heads turned backward. Above them hovers the winged disc of Ahura-Mazda. This complex traditional iconography is rendered in a pure Persian style
Independent panels
The few surviving fragments of this panel were discovered in the north-east corner of the central court of Darius's palace. The panel consisted of moulded bricks glazed all over, including the sides. Unlike friezes of archers or lions, this scene represented a single element in a series of individual panels. It is clear that it was not set into the wall itself, but rather was applied to some projecting feature  (perhaps a pilaster of the same width), and placed in a prominent position, such as in a niche or above a door. The arrangement of the two scenes facing each other and their decorated edge indicate that these were ""free-standing"" panels.
A symmetrical composition, rich in colour
Two sphinxes, hybrid creatures with the body of a winged lion, sit facing each other, their human heads turned back in profile. A wing, curving upward at the tip, springs from the foreleg of each, and the head  rises from an ambiguous part of the body at a region that seems part human torso, part leonine breast The complexion of the face is dark. The eye is shown frontally. A long square-cut beard covers the lower part of the face. The hair emerges from beneath the headdress to be drawn back into a bulky mass at the neck, revealing a bull's ear wearing an ear-ring identical to those worn by archers. The cylindrical ceremonial headdress is endowed with three tiers of horns intended to demonstrate the divine nature of the sphinx.Above the two sphinxes is a disc with a yellow center surrounded by concentric rings of blue and white, flanked by two great outspread wings with a bird's tail beneath. From the meeting point of each wing and the tail there extends a ribbon, tightly curled at the end.
A traditional iconography
The winged disk was the symbol of Ahura-Mazda, ""greatest of the gods,"" a divine emblem ensuring royal and dynastic authority. This motif was borrowed from Egypt, from where it spread to the Levant and Assyria. It is often found in Syrian reliefs of the second millennium BC, where it is the symbol of the god Assur; Achaemenid artists, then, did not have to look far for their inspiration. The theme of paired animals, either facing each other or back to back, is three thousand years old. Having first appeared in the Uruk Period, it was more extensively employed in the first millennium, especially in gold work, ceramic vessels and ivories. The seal-cutters  of the Achaemenid period also made use of the motif. Human-headed animals made their appearance in Early Dynastic reliefs in the form of human-headed bulls, which appear again in two steatite statuettes of the Neo-Sumerian period. Much later, the imposing guardians of the doors of Assyrian palaces probably served as a model for those of the Gate of All Nations which marks the principal entrance into Persepolis. All wear the divine headdress, and their benevolent expressions confirm their role as beneficent spirits. The serene expressions of the sphinxes here seem to have been inspired by the royal model, conforming to the stereotype established in all the brick reliefs at Susa, and in the later stone reliefs at Persepolis. This face recalls the regular features of Darius as depicted on other monuments, which in turn are indistinguishable from those of his son Xerxes and their successors. The same royal canon, more idealized than realist, was applied to them all as evidence of the greatness of the empire. These sphinxes are thus both guardian deities and embodiments of the royal person.

This solid bronze crocodile, which seems to be slowly walking forward, represents much more than the simple saurian that has now disappeared from Egypt. It is actually an image of the god Sobek-Re, crowned with the attributes of a sun god: the solar disk and uraeus.
A swamp dweller
This sturdy creature is clearly a Nile crocodile. Its long jaws are snapped shut but its eyes are wide open: it is not asleep. Its head is raised, and its pointed tail curves slightly to the right. Many details are incised: small lines behind the eyes, rectangles with rounded ends for the horny plates of the back and tail, crisscross pattern for the scales covering the flanks, belly and legs. This crocodile was famous for its strength and voracity; it lived in the waters and on the banks of the Nile, of irrigation canals, swamps, and lakes such as that of Faiyum. It measured up to six meters in length and weighed up to 900 kilos. It was a feature of the aquatic landscape, together with the fish, frogs, and birds on which it fed - and the hippopotamus, the only animal that dared to confront it. The Egyptians might therefore cross its path when they went down to the river or forded it with their flocks, and scenes such as this adorn the funerary chapels of the Old Kingdom.
Sobek-Re, fearsome ""lord of the waters""
The crocodile was both feared (magical spells were recited when fording rivers, to keep it at bay) and identified with several gods including Geb and, above all, Sobek. The latter was portrayed either as a crocodile (as is the case here) or as a crocodile-headed human. His main centers of worship were the Faiyum and Kom Ombo. He was the primordial god of water and fertility, the creator of the world. Classical authors such as Plutarch (1st century AD) observed the habits of this great reptile, which comes out of the water in the morning, spends the day practically immobile on the bank, and plunges back into the water at night. This lifestyle evokes the daily cycle of the sun, which explains why this animal was identified with Ra and became a symbol of rebirth.
Temple-dwelling crocodiles
According to Herodotus (mid 5th century AD) and Strabo (c.30 BC), crocodiles were bred in the temples dedicated to the god Sobek where they were fed by the priests and sometimes adorned with finery. Strabo describes his excursion to Crocodilopolis (Medinet el-Faiyum) where he saw a crocodile being fed with cakes and wine. Such accounts have been confirmed by archaeological discoveries. In 1999, in the Ptolemaic temple dedicated to two crocodile gods at Medinet Madi (in the Faiyum region), an Italian archaeological mission discovered a crocodile nursery, with a number of fossilized eggs.

This bronze lion was discovered during excavations at Mari, a wealthy city in the region of the Middle Euphrates. It was found inside a temple dedicated to a deity known as ""King of the Land,"" together with an almost identical companion statue, which is today housed in the museum of Aleppo, Syria.

Guardian lions?
The two lions were found in their original positions: they were sited side by side on a two-stepped podium attached to the wall, to the left of the entrance to the sanctuary. Only the animals' forequarters are represented, the rear of the two sculptures being built into the wall in such a way that the lions seemed to spring out of it. With their straining necks and their heads turned towards the right, they give the impression of being on the alert, ready to leap into the temple.The inlaying of the eyes, made of limestone and shale, accentuates the intensity of the animals' gaze; the two lions are shown with their mouths open, snarling or roaring. Their curled-back lips revealed teeth made of bone, of which some traces remain in the statue in the Louvre. Crouching in the shadows of the temple, they kept watch as visitors came and went. Although statues of animals as guardians are well documented in the Near East, it was customary to place them outside, as portal sculptures on either side of the entrance to the temple or palace they were supposed to protect. The fact that these lions were located in the interior of the cella suggests that they had a different role from conventional statues of animal guardians.
The masterly craftsmanship of the bronzesmiths of Mari
Exemplifying a technique whose practice is well-documented in Mesopotamia, these two sculptures were made by attaching copper sheets to a frame, probably wood, of which no trace remains. This wood frame had been carved in the shape of the animal, then cold-hammered metal sheets were fastened to it with copper rivets. Eighteen copper sheets were needed to make the Louvre lion. The details  of the mane and whiskers are meticulously carved. On the left shoulder, a star-shaped tuft of fur characterizes the young, vigorous animal. A few details are chased, for example the small ribbon at the base of the animal's right ear. This might indicate that this lion was an animal held in captivity, dedicated perhaps to the deity.
""The Temple of the Lions""
This temple was located in the holy part of the city, built on the southern flank of the High Terrace. The debris of the foundations found buried within its walls indicates that it was built by the Shakkanaku (Prince-Governor) Ishtup-Ilum, who reigned in Mari during the twenty-second century BC. It was dedicated to a god known as ""King of the Land,"" whose exact identity remains unclear. The lions probably were installed when the sanctuary was being rebuilt, at the beginning of the second millennium. André Parrot, the first archeologist to excavate Mari, found several dozen pairs of eyes of the same type as those of the two bronze lions in the vicinity of the temple, and put forward the theory that a pack of about thirty lions once stood guard on the esplanade, which was located in front of the sanctuary. But a recent study showed that not all of these eyes belonged to statues designed to adorn this site. If guardian lions were indeed placed outside the temple, they were fewer in number.

This study of a crowned crane, a bird of Arfrican origin also called the ""royal bird"", was painted from life at the menagerie at Versailles. It belongs to a collection of ""naturalist"" works painted by Boel to serve as models for royal tapestries woven at the Manufacture des Gobelins. 
A painter at the Versailles menagerie
The work of Pieter Boel, a painter of Flemish origin, revolutionized animal painting. Before him, artists had contented themselves with making static studies from stuffed animals for their emblems and allegories. Boel drew and painted his animals from life in the menagerie at Versailles. The menagerie, where he probably set up a makeshift studio, was a small octagonal pavilion surrounded by enclosures in which exotic and domestic animals were kept in semi-liberty. It is thought he often made studies directly onto canvas, without preliminary drawings. Here he represents a crowned crane, a bird of African origin also known as the ""royal bird"".   
Nature and painting
With careful attention to detail, Boel notes the species' different particularities: light eyes ringed with black, finesse, downy lightness of the feather, the graceful neck. But his faithful renditions are far more than mere detailed inventories. He represents animals in their natural, characteristic poses. This study shows the crane in motion, leaning forward, one leg folded, with the other foot spread for optimum balance. The splendid plumage also enables Boel to play on the strong color contrasts between the white, red and black. His free and lively way of applying color shows the true painter beneath the careful observer and clearly sets him apart from a mere scientific illustrator.  
A talented member of Charles Le Brun's team of painters
Pieter Boel belonged to the team of specialized painters who worked on Charles Le Brun's tapestry cartoons for the Manufacture des Gobelins. His animal studies were used as models for the animals in the foreground of the large The Months tapestry, also called The Royal Houses. The motif of the crowned crane is precisely copied in the tapestry that depicts the month of August. The Gobelins workshops were well aware of the value of Boel's animal repertoire and carefully kept his entire set of painted and drawn studies. Another great painter, François Desportes, copied several of them, including this crowned crane (Musée International de la Chasse, Gien). But Boel's legacy surpasses the mere copying of his models: his naturalism and painterly liberty heralded a long line of great animal artists to come, from the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry to the sculptor Antoine Barye.

Along with another fragment in the Louvre, this tapestry must originally have formed part of a more important wall hanging. It bears the coat of arms of the Juvénal des Ursins, a family of magistrates from Champagne, for whom it was probably woven. The most renowned member of the family, Guillaume Juvénal des Ursins (1401-72), was chancellor to kings Charles VII and Louis XI. In addition to playing a decorative role, the tapestry is manifestly designed to impress.
A highly decorative heraldic tapestry
The background of the tapestry is made up of alternating vertical bands of red and white, decorated with uprooted flowers and an initial in negative that seems to be a J. Standing out against this background are two mounds of earth, forming flowered and wooded islands, on each of which stands a bear gripping a tree. The two animals have a long chain around the neck and a short cape over the shoulders. Rising up in the center of the tapestry is a great branch bearing two shields, one with the coat of arms of the Juvénals, the other with a coat of arms that seems to be that of the Sydenhall family.
The ostentatious character of the tapestry
The tapestry seems to have been largely designed to impress. The shield bearing the Juvénal's coat of arms, as well as the letter that serves as a decorative motif and could well be the initial of their name, attests to the importance of that family, who probably commissioned the tapestry. In addition, it displays two emblems of the Juvénal des Ursins, who claimed to be related to the famous Italian family of the Orsini: the bears in the center and, strewn about the background, a flower of the Acanthaceae family, ""Acanthus mollis"", once familiarly called ""ursine"" in French and today ""pied-d'ours"" (or ""bear's breeches"" in English). Guillaume, the most renowned member of the family, had himself portrayed by Jean Fouquet against a background of carved wooden panelling bearing his coat of arms flanked by two small bears and resting on a three-lobed flower, a stylized representation of ""Acanthus mollis"".It is interesting to see here the coat of arms, emblem, and beginning of the family cipher being extended over the entire surface of the fabric, at a time when borders did not yet exist in tapestry.
Possible origins for the tapestry
The alternating bands decorated with floral branches link this fragment to a group of tapestries of which the most famous are the four fragments representing figures in a rose garden, known as ""La Baillée des Roses"" (or Presentation of the Roses), in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. These are attributed to workshops in southern Flanders and are dated to 1450-55. In other respects, the motif of flowered isles set against a background of ""uprooted"" branches - or, as here, flowers - relates this tapestry to a group of ""mille fleurs"" tapestries that form part of a purely French (and specifially Parisian) stylistic trend; the famous Lady and the Unicorn tapestry, in the Musée National du Moyen Age, is probably the best known work of this group and is dated to the late fifteenth century.All of these considerations indicate that this tapestry was made in southern Flanders or France, during the latter part of the fifteenth century.

This clock was originally part of a garniture that comprised two ""foliated"" pot-pourris and two ""sconced"" pot-pourris. This five-piece ensemble was delivered to Madame de Pompadour (1721-1764) for her château at Ménars. In a Rocaille style, the clock is adorned with a ""petit verd"" ground that was very much appreciated by Madame de Pompadour. The mechanism was fashioned by the Parisian clockmaker Jean Romilly (1714-1796) and the rest of the object is Sèvres porcelain.
A Rocaille work
In a markedly Rocaille style, this clock stands in a contoured porcelain case on four legs that terminate in sabots. The face is set in a large scalloped cartouche heightened with combed gilding. The clock is topped with white flowers and foliage in relief, simply enriched with gold. The sides and the back of the case are adorned with polychrome cascades of flowers.
The decoration
Whereas both ""foliated"" pot-pourris (conserved at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore) and both ""sconced"" pot-pourris bear painted decoration of Chinese scenes by Charles-Nicolas Dodin, the clock is endowed with decoration linked to its function. Indeed, the dial-case is crowned with a naturalistic trophy grouping the emblems of time: a scythe, a sand glass, butterfly wings, beribboned scissors, and a distaff. Created in 1760, the ""petit verd"" ground of this clock and the other pieces of the garniture is moreover exceedingly rare. Madame de Pompadour had a marked taste for the ""petit verd"" ground; she incidentally reserved the first pieces decorated with this ground for the Count von Moltke, minister of the king of Denmark.
An ornament for the Château de Ménars
Located between Orleans and Blois, the Château de Ménars was built by Guillaume Charron, Counselor to the King, circa 1646. Madame de Pompadour bought the château and the grounds of Ménars in 1760. She contracted the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel (1698-1782) to redecorate it in the fashion of 1760-1765. Quite fond of porcelain, she commissioned a number of works of Sèvres porcelain for this château, as for other of her residences. The five-piece garniture to which the clock belonged was delivered on June 25, 1762. Until the end of her life, Madame de Pompadour was one of the greatest patrons of the manufactory. She made many purchases there, and undoubtedly supported the move of the Manufactory from Vincennes to Sèvres. Her original and innovative taste gave rise to the most extravagant shapes and ornamentation.

The plaster model for this statue of the young king Henry IV of France was presented at the Salon of 1822. With this work, the neoclassical sculptor Bosio tried his hand at troubadour art - an intimate, anecdotal approach to history. The charm of the statue lies in its air of both youthfulness and gravity. The piece was extremely popular throughout the 19th century.
Henry IV under the Restoration
The prince, aged about ten, stands proudly, his left hand holding the pommel of his sword (broken and stolen in 1881), the right hanging loosely by his side. He is charmingly youthful and serious.This statue evokes Bourbon propaganda under the Restoration: the Bourbons used their glorious past, and the affective potential of Henry IV (founder of the dynasty), to enhance their public image. Bosio was a court favorite whatever the regime; he was portraitist to the imperial family under Napoleon I and court sculptor under Louis XVIII, before being granted the title of baron by Charles X.
The Troubadour style
Bosio was a neoclassical master who sculpted in the great tradition of Canova; this statue, an exception in his work, is an early and successful example of the Troubadour style, which influenced painting from the very start of the 19th century, but had a slighly later impact on sculpture. The precision of costume and accessories is characteristic of the Troubadour style, which views history from an anecdotal, intimate perspective, aiming to move the spectator (unlike neoclassical art, which seeks to edify). The portrayal of kings as children provides a touching contrast between the innocence of their state and the gravity of their destiny. Bosio was probably inspired by a 16th-century portrait of Henry IV at the age of four (Château de Versailles) by François Bunel (1522-1599), court painter to the kings of Navarre.Although the artist respected the antique tradition here by giving the sculpture a calm, impassive, and impersonal appearance, he also gave it the undeniable freshness which made the work so successful.
A phenomenal success
Bosio was given a commission for two marble statues: one for the king's residence (Château de Versailles), the other for the Château de Pau (birthplace of Henry IV). The silver statue in the Louvre was installed (unfinished) in the study of Louis XVIII on 25 August 1824, for the king's name day. Bosio obtained the privilege of making twelve bronze casts. The statuette was copied in a variety of materials throughout the 19th century (there is a brightly colored version in glazed terracotta made by Alfred Brault in the Château de Pau). Barbedienne produced many smaller replicas, thereby making the work available to a wider public.

This moving portrait of a boy with an aged Florentine patrician disfigured by rhinophyma - acne rosacea - may in fact have been painted after the death of the latter: the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm has an excellent Ghirlandaio drawing showing the same man full face, with his eyes closed and apparently on his deathbed. The painting may also have allegorical significance. 
A dual portrait
An old man seated by a window holds in his arms a child whose delicate features are framed by blond ringlets. The man's gentle, benevolent smile and the child's trusting gaze convey their mutual affection. At the same time there is a striking difference in the way each is portrayed: shown in three-quarter view, the old man, recognizable as a Florentine patrician by the cappuccio on his shoulder, is shown with uncompromising realism, the light coming from the right enabling the painter to detail the gray hair, the wart on the forehead, the wrinkles around the eyes, and, especially, the nose deformed by rhinophyma. This image of age and the unsightliness induced by disease is in total contrast with the unsullied profile of the child, with his narrow nose and dainty mouth. 
An intimate atmosphere
Beginning with Fra Filippo Lippi 50 years earlier, the device of the window opening onto a meticulously detailed landscape - originally borrowed from Flemish painting - had often been employed by Florentine portraitists. The luminous red of the old man's fur-trimmed robe and the child's doublet and hat contrasts sharply with the gray of the pietra serena sandstone walls.The tight framing of the scene and the touching intensity of the looks being exchanged add to the intimate atmosphere suffusing this dual image of grandfather and grandson. But is this really a portrait from life?   
A commemorative painting?
A handsome drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum shows the same old man with the same disfigured nose, lying eyes closed on what seems to be his deathbed. The artist may have used this meticulous study to meet a request from the deceased's descendents for a commemorative work on wood. Thus the child is not necessarily the old man's grandson, but perhaps an invented being introduced to render the scene more narrative and poignant, in addition to highlighting the ancestor's goodness and greatness of soul.Ghirlandaio's exceptional skill and his ability to capture personality in his frescoes and paintings on wood earned him a host of commissions from the Florentine aristocracy of the late 15th century.

This regulator clock stands over two meters high on a base with lion claws. In homage to the Count of Toulouse, Admiral of France, for whom it was made, its decoration has a nautical theme, with a ship's castle, dolphins, tritons, crabs, and so on. The central section holds the pendulum, and the upper one the clock face, with the figure of Time and his scythe below it and the figure of Fame with its trumpet above it. The case is a fine example of Boulle marquetry.
History
This regulator was made for Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon (1687-1737), Count of Toulouse, the son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. It was initially placed in the Galerie Dorée, on the first floor of the Hôtel de Toulouse, which is now the Bank of France. In 1756, when an inventory was drawn up following the death of the Duchess of Penthièvre, daughter-in-law of the Count of Toulouse, the clock was found in the Grand Cabinet, next to the Galerie Dorée. During the Revolution, it was assigned to the National Printworks, which were set up in the Hôtel de Rohan. It entered the Louvre in 1915.
A clock in harmony with the paneling of the Galerie Dorée
In 1713 the Count of Toulouse bought the town house built by François Mansart in the seventeenth century, and in 1717 he started work on it. The woodcarver François-Antoine Vassé, general designer for the Royal Navy, carried out the decoration in the Gallery. He used hunting and nautical themes as a reference to the Count of Toulouse's positions as admiral and master of the royal hounds. The regulator is decorated in the same style, to match the ornamental scheme of the gallery, which was thereafter known as the Galerie Dorée, or Golden Gallery.
A timepiece in homage to the Count of Toulouse
The regulator in the Louvre is typical of the Boulle style, using shell and brass marquetry. The cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle (1642-1732) was one of the first to adapt gilt bronze for use in furnishings, thus introducing a sculptural element.                                                                        The cabinetmaker created at least three pieces of furniture in homage to the Count of Toulouse, and these, too, had nautical images as decoration. Besides the regulator, there were a pair of barometers, one of which included a thermometer.

Clocks with animal figures made the reputation of the bronze caster Jean-Joseph de Saint-Germain in the 1750s. What makes the rhinoceros clock distinctive is that it combined gilt bronze and patinated bronze at a time when the two were rarely used together.
Clocks with animal figures
Dating from the 1750s, this striking rhinoceros clock is structured in layers of separate elements: first a base, housing a chime; then a gilt-bronze platform in the rocaille style supporting a patinated bronze rhinoceros; a circular case; and the figure of a young Indian in gilt bronze. Rhinoceroses and elephants seem to have been the most popular choice for clocks with animal figures. But there are also clocks with lions, horses, boars, dragons, and camels. The model shown here is one of the most famous and most popular designs created by the bronze caster Jean-Joseph de Saint-Germain (1719-91).
A model often reproduced
Many examples of the rhinoceros model can still be found today, evidence of its popularity in the eighteenth century. The base of the clock in the Louvre is curved, plated with tortoiseshell, and decorated with gilt-bronze mounts. Other clocks of a similar model have bases plated with different materials (""corne verte,"" for instance). Sometimes these clocks do not have a base.
Artists working together
The clockmaker Francois Viger (1704-84) produced the movement of the rhinoceros clock in the Louvre. On several occasions he worked with the bronze caster Jean-Joseph de Saint-Germain, who created the cases for the clocks.

This sundial dates from the imperial era and is an exceptional example of a scaphe, or bowl sundial, with a hole to let through a ray of sunlight. The interior is engraved with lines and inscriptions in Greek; the spot lit by the sunbeam would give the month, day, and hour. This sundial is in the shape of a skyphos or drinking vessel, a fashionable shape for luxury Roman tableware at the end of the republic. The exterior is decorated with oak twigs and acorns.
Shape and ornamentation inspired by luxury tableware
This sundial is in the form of a skyphos, a style of deep drinking vessel that was a very fashionable item of luxury Roman tableware in the final years of the republic and the 1st century AD. The Boscoreale Treasure, a trove of silverware now in the Louvre, contains similar examples. The vessel has a handle on each side. The exterior of the marble bowl is decorated with concentric moldings, and, as with similar vessels made of metal, the sides are decorated with a carved foliage motif, in this case oak twigs with acorns. On one side of the vessel are a round hole and a thick tenon, which would originally have been part of a mortise and tenon joint attaching the sundial to its pedestal.
How the sundial worked
The sundial was positioned vertically with the hole uppermost and the concave bowl facing the observer. The interior of the bowl is engraved with a network of curving lines accompanied by Greek inscriptions, some abbreviated, giving the dates of the Roman calendar. The broadest division corresponds to the summer solstice, 24 June, and the narrowest the winter solstice, 25 December.The fan of eleven lines dividing the curving sections marks the length of the twelve daytime hours of the Roman day, which were longer in summer and shorter in winter. The hole in the vessel let through a ray of sunlight that marked the month, day, and hour, moving round the bowl as the position of the sun changed. The opening would originally have been partly closed off with a bronze plaque, restricting the opening and thus focusing the beam more precisely, but this has been lost. The sundial was made for use at a latitude of 41 . If it was found in Carthage, which is at a lower latitude, it must have been transported there after manufacture.
The typology and date of the sundial
The ninth book of De Architectura, written by Vitruvius in the first century BC, is a key source of information about the use of sundials in antiquity. Vitruvius, a Roman engineer, listed the different types of sundial, but the descriptions are unclear, making it difficult to determine what sort of dial the work now in the Louvre originally would have been called. The complex web of lines on the inner surface of the bowl are similar to the description of the type of dial that Vitruvius termed arachne, the spider, attributing its invention to the astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus in the 4th century BC. It seems more likely, however, that the sundial is the common scaphe type (from the Greek skaphein, to hollow out). Scaphes were bowl sundials with a hole letting through a ray of light. The shape of the vessel, the style of ornamentation, and the inscriptions seem to indicate that the object dates from the imperial era, some time in the 1st or 2nd century AD. The fact that the month of August is named augustus indicates that the piece dates from after 8 BC, when the month sextilis was renamed in honor of the emperor Augustus.

173,Time,Sarcophage du roi Ramsès III,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/sarcophagus-box-ramesses-iii?selection=44886,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-sarcophage-roi-ramses-iii.jpg?1527818366,"
This pink granite cartouche-shaped box once contained the nest of coffins of Pharaoh Ramesses III. The lid is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The outside of the box is engraved with the seventh and eighth chapters of the ""Book of Amduat"", and the inside with the first chapter of the ""Book of Gates."" Certain parts of these texts were very carelessly engraved.
Description
The decoration of this monolithic cartouche-shaped block is organized around the large winged figure of Isis at the feet of the deceased (on the flat front of the sarcophagus) and that of Nephthys at his head (on the rounded back of the box). Both long sides are engraved with scenes taken from the ""Book of Hidden Chambers"" (the Amduat). The decoration begins near the figure of Nephthys at the king's head, with the seventh hour of the Amduat along the right side (looking from the head to the feet), and continues with the eighth hour along the left side. Around the base of the coffin is the palace façade motif - a relic of Old Kingdom sarcophagi (cf. sarcophagus of Abu Roach, Room 14). The inside of the box features large figures of deities from the first hour of the ""Book of Gates.""
The sun's night-time journey
The Egyptians imagined the sun to travel underground in a boat during the twelve hours of night. The nocturnal sun was represented as a man with a ram's head. Every ""hour"" (i.e. every stage of his journey) was marked by a particular event: at the seventh hour, for example (right-hand side of the coffin), the sun confronts the snake Apophis, the ""evil serpent"" of Egyptian texts, who tries to stop him on his course. The sun-god is portrayed armed with knives to destroy him. The left-hand side represents the eighth hour: on the lower register, the creatures of the Underworld are depicted, sitting on the ideogram for fabric (one of the essential funerary offerings). The texts referring to the sun's night-time journey (""Litanies of the Sun"", ""Amduat"", ""Book of Gates"", ""Book of Night"", etc.) were composed during the New Kingdom for the exclusive use of the king. As the pharaoh was associated with the sun god and his perilous journey through the night, the royal tomb featured representations of this recurrent event. After the New Kingdom, some of these texts (especially the Amduat) were also used for the benefit of priests and soldiers who were at the peak of their influence at that time (see the papyri in vitrine 4).
Slapdash work
Only two scenes from the Amduat are illustrated on the sarcophagus of Ramesses III, which is characterized by extraordinary carelessness on the part of the scribe who engraved the introductory text to the seventh hour (to the right of the figure of Nephthys). The phrases (and even individual words) are cut up into incoherent elements that cannot be understood without referring to the correct version featured in other tombs. This poor reproduction, without subsequent checking, suggests that, in the late New Kingdom, the monarchy was no longer treated with the respect it had once inspired.

Tamutnefret, a singer of Amun, was buried in a superb set of two beautifully decorated coffins, with an openwork decorated wood top covering her mummy. These coffins present an idealized image of the deceased, represented as a wrapped mummy, like Orisis. The various spirits and deities depicted on each of the elements were meant to provide Tamutnefret with magical protection for safe survival in the afterlife.
An early acquisition
This extremely beautiful set of coffins was probably brought back from Egypt by Jean-François Champollion, who deciphered ancient hieroglyphs and was the first curator of the Louvre's Egyptian collection, after his trip to Egypt in 1830. They are in perfect condition, and are entirely characteristic of funerary groups found from the early Ramessid period, notably the 19th Dynasty.
Tamutnefret's coffins
Tamutnefret is depicted on the coffin covers wearing a heavy wig, with gilded strips on the sides. Her gentle, smiling face is entirely gilded and is framed by two large locks of hair; a wide floral band wraps around her head. A magnificent collar covers her chest and crossed arms; only her gilded hands are not covered. At her waist is an elegant image of Nut, the goddess of the sky, portrayed in a kneeling pose with her winged arms spread in a protective gesture. Three vertical lines of texts, crossed by horizontal lines representing the linen strips of the mummy, cover her legs. These texts include the names and titles of the deceased, the singer of Amun, Tamutnefret, as well as a simple appeal asking Nut to place her among the eternal stars, a common prayer during this era. Vertical lines of inscriptions along the outer walls of the coffin frame images of the ibis-headed god Thot, the dog-headed god Anubis, and the four sons of Horus: Imsety (with a human head), Duamutef (with a dog's head), Hapi (with a monkey's head), and Qebehsenuf (with a falcon's head). The gilding that covers the visible parts of Tamoutnefret's body, hands, face, and neck, evokes the flesh of the gods.
The cover of Tamutnefret's mummy
A two-part wooden cover was placed over Tamutnefret's mummy. The top section covered the upper part of the body; the bottom section protected the stomach and legs. The face of the deceased is identical to that on the covers, and she is also depicted with her arms crossed over her chest. On this object, however, the soft folds of her flared sleeves are indicated by thin red lines. The bottom section is a good example of an openwork wood design. A central line of inscriptions under the image of Nut continues all the way to the feet, and is intersected at regular intervals by horizontal bands of writing. Two small scenes depict the ibis-headed god Thot offering the wedjat eye, a symbol of physical integrity, to a seated god, whose body is wrapped in a shroud. The rest of the décor depicts Tamutnefret standing and worshipping or playing a sistrum opposite Anubis and the four sons of Horus. Finally, two kneeling goddesses at her feet, Isis and Nephtys, weep for the deceased as they grieved for Osiris in the myth.

This exceptional monument, a sarcophagus or cinerary urn, comes from Caere (modern Cerveteri), a city famous in the Archaic period for its clay sculpture. It features the deceased tenderly entwined, reclining on a bed in the attitude of banqueters, in accordance with a style that originated in Asia Minor. They are making the gesture of offering perfume, a ritual that, along with the sharing of wine, was part of the funeral ceremony.
An example of terracotta sculpture from Caere
The Sarcophagus of the Spouses was found in 1845 by the Marquis Campana in the Banditaccia necropolis in Caere (modern Cerveteri). Purchased in 1861 by Napoleon III, this monument has often been regarded as a sarcophagus because of its exceptional dimensions. However, its function remains uncertain because burial and cremation were both practiced by the Etruscans. It may actually have been a large urn designed to contain the ashes of the deceased. Only one example similar to this work is known (Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia, Rome), which also demonstrates the high level of skill attained by the sculptors of Caere in clay sculpture during the late 6th century BC.During the Archaic period, terracotta was one of the preferred materials in the workshops of Caere for funeral monuments and architectural decoration. The ductility of clay offered artisans numerous possibilities, compensating for the lack of stone suitable for sculpture in southern Etruria.
Funerary banquet and ritual
This urn takes the form of a bed, upon which the deceased are resting in the position of banqueters. This theme was not an Etruscan invention, but originated in Asia Minor: the Etruscans, like the Greeks before them, had adopted the eastern custom of feasting in a reclining position, and the conventional method of representing it. Unlike in the Greek world, where banquets were reserved for men, the Etruscan woman, who held an important place in society, is represented by her husband's side, in the same proportions and in a similar pose. The couple are reclining on cushions in the form of wineskins, a reference to the sharing of wine, a ceremony that was part of funerary ritual. Tenderly clasped by her husband, the deceased woman is pouring a few drops of perfume into his hand, probably from an alabastron, as can be seen on a small urn displayed nearby (cinerary urn with the spouses on the lid, Louvre, CP 5193); in so doing, she is making the gesture of offering perfume, another essential component of funerary ritual. In her left hand she is holding a small, round object, possibly a pomegranate, a symbol of immortality.
The influence of eastern Greece
The style of this monument shows the influence exerted by artists from eastern Greece on Etruscan art-particularly the Ionians, who emigrated in large numbers during the late 6th century BC. The casket and the lid are decorated with bright paintwork, now partially disappeared, which adds to the elegance of the woman's finery, and to the details of the fabrics and the hair. The smiling faces and full forms of the bodies are also inspired by Ionian sculpture. However, some of the features are typical of Etruscan art, such as a certain lack of formal coherence, the way the legs in particular have received less plastic volume, and the emphasis on the gestures of the deceased.

The famous Zodiac of Dendera confounds today's visitors who may look for a reflection of modern-day astrological beliefs. This bas-relief actually represented a night skyscape, on the ceiling of a chapel in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, where the mysteries of the resurrection of the god Osiris were celebrated.
A ceiling decorated with an image of the sky
This sandstone slab comes from the domain dedicated to the goddesses Hathor and Isis at Dendera. It was part of the ceiling of one of the chapels where the resurrection of Osiris was commemorated, on the roof of the great Temple of Hathor.The vault of heaven is represented by a disc, held up by four women assisted by falcon-headed spirits. Thirty-six spirits or ""decans"" around the circumference symbolize the 360 days of the Egyptian year. The constellations shown inside the circle include the signs of the zodiac, most of which are represented almost as they are today. Aries, Taurus, Scorpio, and Capricorn, for example, are easily recognizable, whereas others correspond to a more Egyptian iconography: Aquarius is represented as Hapy, the god of the Nile flood, pouring water from two vases. The constellations of the northern sky, featured in the center, include the Great Bear (Ursa Major) in the form of a bull's foreleg. A hippopotamus goddess, opposite Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, represents the constellation of the Dragon.
An astronomical configuration corresponding to a specific date
The five planets that were known at the time are associated with certain signs of the zodiac: Venus (""the god of the morning"") is behind Aquarius, Jupiter (""Horus who Reveals the Mystery"") is near Cancer, Mars (""Horus the Red"") is directly above Capricorn. Mercury is called ""the Inert"" and Saturn ""Horus the Bull"". This particular configuration of the planets among the constellations occurs only about once every thousand years; an astrophysicist has dated it between 15 June and 15 August 50 BC. Two eclipses are represented exactly where they occurred. The solar eclipse of 7 March 51 is depicted as the goddess Isis holding a baboon (the god Thoth) by its tail, signifying her attempt to stop the moon from hiding the sun. The lunar eclipse of 25 September 52 is represented by an udjat-eye (the ""whole one""), because a lunar eclipse only occurs when the moon is full.
The Zodiac, an Egyptian-style illustration?
The Zodiac of Dendera was transported to France in 1821 with the permission of Egyptian ruler Mohamed Ali Pasha. It is one of the most famous Egyptian monuments preserved in France.It should be interpreted as a map of the sky rather than a giant horoscope or a perpetual astrological tool. However, the Egyptians believed that certain constellations and decans could have a negative influence on their destiny or health.The representations of the signs of the zodiac as we know them today did not appear in Egypt until the Greco-Roman Period. This monument reflects the way Egyptian cultural elements merged with Babylonian and Greek astronomical and astrological theories, as a result of the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations of the 8th and 6th centuries BC, and the Persian and Greek invasions of the 6th and 4th centuries.

Combining decorative elements suggesting plant and mineral forms, this dissymmetrical, typically Rocaille wall clock became part of the royal collection in 1787. It was housed in the chambers of the King's Minister at the Royal Furniture Repository in Paris before being transferred to the Mobilier National. The clock is set in bronze with ebony veneer and brass and tortoiseshell marquetry on the sides. The composition features Cupid seated on a cloud and Time on a rocky mound.
Love, Vanquisher of Time
Clockmakers made extensive use of the theme of Love overcoming Time as decoration for clock casings. The Cupid at the top is a cherub embodying the idea of youth. He dominates the composition as a whole, especially the bent figure below of an old man representing Time.
A fine example of Rocaille
Originally the cherub's left arm leaned on an hourglass, while in the lower part of the clock there were two tall trees, one on each side of a trefoil cartouche. These missing elements brought a degree of balance to a composition whose marked dissymmetry has earned this wall clock a reputation as the most characteristically Rocaille of all Charles Cressent's creations.
Related works
At least five examples of this model are known to exist: in addition to the one in the Louvre, others are found in the Mayor's office at City Hall in Marseille, the Wallace Collection in London (dated 1764), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Wrightsman Collection), and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Other clockmakers were responsible for the mechanisms of these clocks.

Around the middle of the eighteenth century, competition between porcelain factories forced faience makers to adopt new techniques. This faience clock, produced in the Strasbourg workshop of Paul Hannong, was possibly inspired from a model by the Parisian cabinetmaker Charles Cressent. With its complex rococo shape, it demonstrates the ""petit-feu"" (low-fired) technique in all its glory. This technique meant that the range of colors could be considerably broadened.
An exceptional rococo work of art
This large decorative faience piece has a casing which contains the clock's movement (ordered from a local Strasbourg clockmaker) and a base in the form of a console. It is possibly based on a model by the cabinetmaker Charles Cressent, who often used a figure known as an 'espagnolette', a female bust in ronde-bosse (in the round as opposed to relief). However, credit must go to German manufacturers for the creation of this type of wall clock in ceramic. This particular example must have had pride of place in a home which was similarly rococo in style, since its undulating forms are in perfect harmony with the taste for curved lines that characterised rococo - a trend which remained fashionable until the second third of the eighteenth century. Scrolls, shells, and garlands of flowers form the basis of the ornamentation and echo one another, while the upper section, above the cockerel, is dominated by the figure of Time armed with its scythe. 
An innovative workshop
The Hannong family ran their workshop in Strasbourg from 1721 to 1784, during which time it became renowned for its new techniques and the quality of its painted decoration. Thanks to the presence of German workers, it became the first workshop in the history of French ceramics to practice ""petit-feu"" firing, and the first in France to master the manufacture of hard porcelain. As well as whole services (and in particular plates and dishes), it produced many individual pieces like statuettes, pots-pourris, fountains, and clocks, in which great technical skill was involved. At least three types of clock are known to have been produced in the workshop. Others, on the same model as the one in the Louvre, can be seen at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
A new palette for use in decoration
The relief sections are highlighted by a palette of colors known as ""petit-feu"", or reflected colors. This technique was introduced into the Paul Hannong workshop around 1745. It was a new process that involved firing at a lower temperature, enabling a palette of colors to be produced which could not be obtained through firing at high temperature. Particularly characteristic is the introduction of pink, which was arrived at through mixing gold and pewter chloride (or ""purple of Cassius""). The new range of colors is used here to emphasize sculpted shapes with soft blues, yellows, and greens, or to highlight edges with subtle touches of color from reds to browns, and to give greater realism to the figures through the use of mellow tones.

Philopoemen, a Greek military strategist renowned for his courage, has been wounded during a battle. As he pulls out the javelin that has been hurled through his thigh, his face expresses both his pain and his fierce determination to return to the fray. While depicting a heroic antique-style nude, the sculptor has added movement, controlled energy, and an expressiveness that shows his Romantic aspirations.
A Greek hero
In 222 BC, Philopoemen took part in the Battle of Sellasia, where he fought under the command of Antigonus Doson, King of Macedonia, against Cleomenes, King of Sparta. When wounded, Philopoemen stoically removed the javelin that had broken in his thigh. The episode is related in the Greek author Plutarch's Lives (lines 46-125), a book that draws parallels between famous Greeks and Romans. As an Achaean strategist, Philopoemen later attempted to build a united Greek alliance to counter the threat of Roman intervention. During an expedition against the city of Messina (183 BC), he was taken prisoner and forced to drink hemlock.
Antique subject, modern execution
David d'Angers carved a nude figure of his hero, as in antique statuary. He retained a number of the warrior's attributes: crested helmet, baldric, and sword. The cloak, whose folds fall across the shield, provides the occasion for a fine study of classical drapery. But the sculptor abandoned purity of line and idealized facial features to invest his work with an expressive force, characteristic of the Romantic spirit. The monumental proportions (the marble is larger than life), the almost exaggerated modeling of a powerful, muscular body, and the enormous head transform Philopoemen into a colossus. The imperious facial features, the frown on his brow, the gaze at once full of pain and defiant, and the thick hair and beard give him a ferocious appearance. The curve of the arms, the line of the shoulders, and the raised head, whose movement is extended by the crest on the helmet, animate the statue with a vast upward thrust.
An example of virtue
The sculptor strove to reconcile physical nature with a moral essence. Seen from the right-hand side, the side with the wound, the statue depicts the man suffering, with back and leg bent. Seen from the other side, the statue represents a hero full of pride with raised head and hostile gaze. The work thus pays homage to the hero's stoic courage, which dominates his pain so that he may accomplish his duty.Although Philopoemen was only thirty years of age at the time of the battle, the sculptor represented him as an older man. As he explained in his Notebooks, he disregarded historical truth because he wanted to depict ""the last Greek"" (as Plutarch called him), that is, ""a great old monument which fought against storms before falling."" The statue is displayed beside other sculptures of ancient heroes, commissioned by the government of Louis-Philippe, such as the Soldier of Marathon by Jean-Pierre Cortot (1787-1843) and Cato of Utica by Jean-Baptiste Roman (1792-1835). They were all revered as ""great men,"" whose courage and patriotic or civic virtues were intended to set the public an example.

Spartacus was the rebel gladiator who raised an army of slaves against Rome, multiplying victories before being defeated by Crassus in 71 BC. He is represented here having just broken his chains. Arms folded, with an expression of grim determination, he seems to be plotting his revenge. In 1830, due to political opportunism, the sculpture came to symbolize the July Revolution.
The story
Foyatier presented the plaster model for his statue of Spartacus at the Paris Salon of 1827. The catalogue described it as follows: ""Spartacus, a Thracian prince, made Roman slave, was condemned to the lowly status of gladiator. Having escaped from prison, he raised an army of malcontents, and struck terror right into heart of Rome. He is represented at the moment when he has just broken his chains."" The story of Spartacus was told by Greek author Plutarch in his Lives (v. 46-v.125), a work that drew parallels between famous Greeks and Romans.
Highly expressive sculpture
This sculpture won instant acclaim. It was considered by some to herald the revival of neoclassical statuary. It indeed corresponded to academic canons: Spartacus is naked, as were antique heroes, and his imposing stature is consistent with the grand style that established a correlation between the dimensions of a work and the impression it created. This sculpture was no doubt inspired by the work of Canova, especially his Damoxenes (Vatican Museum, Rome): it has the same pose and tense, muscular concentration.On the other hand, the character's expressivity - the air of contained rage communicated by his attitude - was sometimes associated with Romantic sensibility.
Political opportunism
The success of this work was also due to its subject. Spartacus was rarely represented in sculpture, and the statue was perceived as a symbol of opposition to the regime of Charles X, although this does not seem to have been the artist's original intention. Foyatier made the model at the Villa Medicis in Rome, where he was a guest from 1822 to 1825. He exhibited it at the 1827 Salon, and the marble used was commissioned by the royal administration. But by the time the sculpture was finished, the Trois Glorieuses (the July Revolution of 1830) had overthrown the regime of Charles X. Foyatier took this opportunity to make Spartacus a Republican icon, by dating the work 29 July 1830 (the last day of the Revolution).

This funerary monument was dedicated to Iulia Victorina, who died at the age of ten years and five months. The little girl is represented on both sides, with the attributes of the moon and the sun. The crescent moon on her head evokes the soul's stay in the lunar regions. On the back she is depicted as a young woman wearing a radiate diadem in reference to the solar immortality it was hoped she would enjoy after death.
Private funerary art
From the Republican period onward, the most common mortuary practice in Rome was cremation. The ashes of the deceased were collected and placed in an urn made of terra-cotta, glass, or stone. The location of the tombs was indicated by an altar or cippus, which contained the cinerary urn. Some great families buried their dead in stone sarcophagi, but it was only from the second century AD that burial took over from cremation and sarcophagi replaced cinerary urns. Toward the end of the first century BC, the production of marble urns expanded considerably. These were richly sculpted with ornamental and plant motifs, then mythological subjects, which were very fashionable during the first century AD. The decoration of funerary monuments, altars, cippi, and urns borrowed many motifs from imperial iconography, which was familiar from public buildings. Private funerary art drew from the official repertory of Augustan art and quickly became conventional. But popular sensibility also found expression through a great number of symbols that echoed the piety of Roman society and diversified the range of models.
Iulia Victorina's altar
This altar, dated circa AD 75-90, was dedicated to the manes of Iulia Victorina by her parents, Gaius Iulius Saturninus and Lucilla Procula. The epitaph engraved on the front of the monument specifies that the little girl died an untimely death at the age of ten years and five months.
Roman funerary symbolism
On one of the faces of the cippus, the child's portrait is topped with a crescent moon, which evokes the soul's stay in the lunar regions. On the back, the deceased girl is portrayed as a young woman, crowned with a radiate diadem. The sun's rays announce the solar immortality that awaits her after her stay in the realm of the night star. The short sides of the altar are sculpted with laurels that shelter crows in their branches. This was a recurrent motif in private funerary art from the Julio-Claudian period. The evergreen laurel was a symbol of immortality dedicated to the sun god Apollo. It also referred indirectly to the imperial order, as Apollo was the divine protector of the Augustan dynasty. Indeed, laurels were planted in front of the emperor Augustus' Palatine residence. The tree also evokes Helios, the sun god who restored intelligence after death. The crow was another solar symbol, associated with Apollo.

The theme of the prayer before meals, treated by the Dutch masters of the 17th century, is reinterpreted in this tender and understated scene, one of the most famous works by Chardin. The rough painting of his early career gives way here, for the first time, to a smoother and more polished execution.

	The contented life of duty

	Here we see the striking difference between Chardin and painters like Boucher. Chardin stresses deserving and hidden virtues, the contented life of duty, and clean and well-fitting humble dresses - not the coquetry of marquises, garden luncheons, and moonlit promenades.
	A circle of figures look at one another and the shape is repeated in the tablecloth and the dishes, part of the circle of tenderness that is work's chief subject. The theme is an old one: a mother teaches her children to recite a prayer before the meal.

	Immediate success

	A work of simple composition and refined execution, treating a subject of deliberate banality, Grace was an immediate success. The moralization of the subject, exaltation of a simple family life, and palpable intimacy explain the philosopher Diderot's great enthusiasm for Chardin's genre scenes.

	The Louis XV Collection

	Exhibited at the Salon of 1740, this genre scene was purchased by Louis XV and remained in the royal collections until the French Revolution; it then entered the Muséum Central des Arts, which would later become the Louvre, in 1793. A replica of this work, with slight differences, was part of the Dominique Vivant-Denon Collection before being bequeathed to the Louvre in 1869 by Dr. Louis La Caze.

The plaster model for this statue of the young king Henry IV of France was presented at the Salon of 1822. With this work, the neoclassical sculptor Bosio tried his hand at troubadour art - an intimate, anecdotal approach to history. The charm of the statue lies in its air of both youthfulness and gravity. The piece was extremely popular throughout the 19th century.
Henry IV under the Restoration
The prince, aged about ten, stands proudly, his left hand holding the pommel of his sword (broken and stolen in 1881), the right hanging loosely by his side. He is charmingly youthful and serious.This statue evokes Bourbon propaganda under the Restoration: the Bourbons used their glorious past, and the affective potential of Henry IV (founder of the dynasty), to enhance their public image. Bosio was a court favorite whatever the regime; he was portraitist to the imperial family under Napoleon I and court sculptor under Louis XVIII, before being granted the title of baron by Charles X.
The Troubadour style
Bosio was a neoclassical master who sculpted in the great tradition of Canova; this statue, an exception in his work, is an early and successful example of the Troubadour style, which influenced painting from the very start of the 19th century, but had a slighly later impact on sculpture. The precision of costume and accessories is characteristic of the Troubadour style, which views history from an anecdotal, intimate perspective, aiming to move the spectator (unlike neoclassical art, which seeks to edify). The portrayal of kings as children provides a touching contrast between the innocence of their state and the gravity of their destiny. Bosio was probably inspired by a 16th-century portrait of Henry IV at the age of four (Château de Versailles) by François Bunel (1522-1599), court painter to the kings of Navarre.Although the artist respected the antique tradition here by giving the sculpture a calm, impassive, and impersonal appearance, he also gave it the undeniable freshness which made the work so successful.
A phenomenal success
Bosio was given a commission for two marble statues: one for the king's residence (Château de Versailles), the other for the Château de Pau (birthplace of Henry IV). The silver statue in the Louvre was installed (unfinished) in the study of Louis XVIII on 25 August 1824, for the king's name day. Bosio obtained the privilege of making twelve bronze casts. The statuette was copied in a variety of materials throughout the 19th century (there is a brightly colored version in glazed terracotta made by Alfred Brault in the Château de Pau). Barbedienne produced many smaller replicas, thereby making the work available to a wider public.

Louise and Alexandre were the children of Alexandre Théodore Brongniart, the famous architect of the Bourse (old Stock Exchange) in Paris. These busts demonstrate Houdon's marvelous ability to express the freshness of childhood without sentimentality. Louise still has the slight chubbiness of a young infant. In his rendering of her eyes, Houdon portrays her with the serious expression children sometimes have. Young Alexandre became a mineralogist and director of the Sèvres porcelain manufactory.
The Brongniart children
Louise and Alexandre were the children of the architect Alexandre Théodore Brongniart (1739-1813), famous for having built the Paris Bourse (old Stock Exchange), the Palais Brongniart. Brongniart was also the designer of the Capuchin monastery in the Rue d'Antin (now the Lycée Condorcet) and a friend of the sculptor Clodion. His son, Alexandre Brongniart, became a distinguished mineralogist and a specialist in firing techniques, directing the Sèvres porcelain manufactory from 1800 to 1847.
History of busts of children
Busts of children were very rare in the 17th century and first half of the 18th century, but from 1750-60 onward they became increasingly common. This phenomenon echoed a shift in mentality with regard to childhood, as reflected in the publication of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile in 1762. It was also explained by the sculpted portrait becoming accessible to wider circles of society, and also by the development of ""study heads"" - usually portraits that were idealized to a greater or lesser degree.Houdon showed an interest in children's portraits very early on, during his training period in Italy. He sent a child's head sculpted in marble to his first Salon in 1769. At this Salon, Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne - who, without being Houdon's teacher, nonetheless advised him when he was starting out - presented his Little Girl with a Scarf (Louvre).
The Brongniart children by Houdon
The busts of the Brongniart children established the sculptor's marvelous ability to depict the freshness and innocence of childhood without sentimentalism, expressing the personality of his subjects. The two busts were designed to contrast with each other. They turn their heads in opposite directions. Alexandre is dressed; Louise is nude. The liveliness of the boy is reflected in his unkempt hair, open jacket, mischievous look, and in the more vigorous modeling of the face. Louise seems more poised: she still has the round cheeks of a very young child, and her hair is carefully swept up in a bun secured by a band with a bow on the top. The color of the eyes is conveyed by differing treatments: Alexandre's irises, rendered by two concentric rows of radiating incisions, give the impression of light-colored eyes, whereas Louise's irises are deeply hollowed out, the resulting shadow imparting a darker, more serious look. The sculptor has left a small element in relief at the edge of the pupil to catch the light, which heightens the lifelike nature of the gaze. Houdon has not been surpassed - except perhaps by himself - in his portraits of his own children, Sabine (Louvre), Anne-Ange (Louvre), and Claudine (Worcester Art Museum).These two terra-cotta portraits were presented at the 1777 Salon and became very popular. Many marble and bronze versions of them were made, and they were reproduced in Sèvres biscuit porcelain and in terra-cotta. The busts remained in the Brongniart family until the Louvre purchased them - Louise's portrait in 1898 and Alexandre's in 1900.

This portrait of Francis George Hare is the most famous picture by Reynolds in France. A young boy with long hair, about two years old, is shown wearing a very young child's clothes. He is dressed in a chiffon outfit, as children of his age and class were. This picture swiftly became famous, and is one of the archetypal images of British art.
Simple portrait of innocence or a deeper reflection on the world of childhood?
It is rare to see such a natural pose in a portrait, even of a child. It is marvellous how Reynolds encapsulates the innocence of this very young boy. His ringlets, his rosy cheeks, but above all the entirely free pose of his right arm conspire to create a lively and spontaneous figure. The almost ethereal background of trees and greenery only enhances the feelings of natural harmony, authenticity, and spontaneity.Reynolds creates a perfect setting for this small boy, who looks beyond the frame at something in the distance that no one else can perceive. His white skin, his bright eyes, and his dynamic pose contrast with the somber colors of the background. In creating such a setting, Reynolds wished to demonstrate the primacy of a child's world that cares little for external matters. The subtle echoes between the child's blond hair, the bronze reflections on the tree behind him, and the material that forms the child's belt enliven the picture, thereby emphasizing the child's sweetness.
Childhood in a frame
Children's portraits are one of the glories of Reynolds's output. Some of them, like that of Penelope Boothby, evoke the sweetness and poetry of childhood. Others highlight instead the humor or simplicity of childhood. More elegant, more conventional, and less tender portraits by other artists serve to remind us how important spontaneity was to Reynolds.The tradition of the ""great portrait"" had already been subverted, particularly by Gainsborough, who painted a famous portrait of a child, the Blue Boy. However, by reducing the size of the frame and abandoning the necessity to show the person portrayed standing up, Gainsborough managed to allow a natural freshness to shine through. When Reynolds's picture was engraved by Robert Thew in 1790, the engraving was given the title Infancy, and it subsequently became the archetypal illustration of the young child type in England.
Reynolds: a major figure in English art
At the start of the eighteenth century, foreign artists dominated painting in England.To change this situation, it was necessary to establish and promote native artists and to create a British art with unique characteristics. In 1768 the British Academy was founded in London. Its aims were rapidly crowned with success, due mainly to frequent exhibitions.Having striven for a long time to have British art recognized, Reynolds became the first president of the Royal Academy. He promulgated a demanding Classical training, which we know about thanks to the discourses he delivered to students at awards ceremonies, which were subsequently published. Recognized for his huge talent, Reynolds was considered one of the greatest English painters at his death in 1792.

This moving portrait of a boy with an aged Florentine patrician disfigured by rhinophyma - acne rosacea - may in fact have been painted after the death of the latter: the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm has an excellent Ghirlandaio drawing showing the same man full face, with his eyes closed and apparently on his deathbed. The painting may also have allegorical significance. 
A dual portrait
An old man seated by a window holds in his arms a child whose delicate features are framed by blond ringlets. The man's gentle, benevolent smile and the child's trusting gaze convey their mutual affection. At the same time there is a striking difference in the way each is portrayed: shown in three-quarter view, the old man, recognizable as a Florentine patrician by the cappuccio on his shoulder, is shown with uncompromising realism, the light coming from the right enabling the painter to detail the gray hair, the wart on the forehead, the wrinkles around the eyes, and, especially, the nose deformed by rhinophyma. This image of age and the unsightliness induced by disease is in total contrast with the unsullied profile of the child, with his narrow nose and dainty mouth. 
An intimate atmosphere
Beginning with Fra Filippo Lippi 50 years earlier, the device of the window opening onto a meticulously detailed landscape - originally borrowed from Flemish painting - had often been employed by Florentine portraitists. The luminous red of the old man's fur-trimmed robe and the child's doublet and hat contrasts sharply with the gray of the pietra serena sandstone walls.The tight framing of the scene and the touching intensity of the looks being exchanged add to the intimate atmosphere suffusing this dual image of grandfather and grandson. But is this really a portrait from life?   
A commemorative painting?
A handsome drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum shows the same old man with the same disfigured nose, lying eyes closed on what seems to be his deathbed. The artist may have used this meticulous study to meet a request from the deceased's descendents for a commemorative work on wood. Thus the child is not necessarily the old man's grandson, but perhaps an invented being introduced to render the scene more narrative and poignant, in addition to highlighting the ancestor's goodness and greatness of soul.Ghirlandaio's exceptional skill and his ability to capture personality in his frescoes and paintings on wood earned him a host of commissions from the Florentine aristocracy of the late 15th century.

The Louvre has two panels from a group known as the Magdeburg Ivories, a set of sixteen panels given to the church of St. Maurice in Magdeburg by Emperor Otto I (d. 973), probably when it became a cathedral in 968. Differing in style, the two panels in the Louvre are the work of different artists employed in the same workshop, commissioned by Otto.
An episode that is seldom depicted
The scene is set against a background pierced with crosses. A child stands in the center, surrounded by larger figures, among them the haloed Christ, who is leaning toward the child and pointing him out to the apostles, one of whom is recognizable as St. Peter. The scene comes from a relatively unfamiliar episode in the New Testament (and one seldom depicted in medieval iconography), when Christ calls a small child to him and says to the apostles: ""Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven"" (Matt. 18: 1-6; Luke 9: 47-48).
The Magdeburg Ivories
The powerful modeling, geometrical forms, and compact composition identify this panel as one of the Magdeburg Ivories, of which sixteen survive today. They will originally have adorned an important item of church furnishing - an antependium, bishop's throne, or chancel door, for instance - and were donated to the abbey church of St. Maurice by Emperor Otto I (936-973), most likely when the abbey became a cathedral on the establishment of Magdeburg as an archbishopric in 968. Whatever its function, the original piece was dismantled not very long after, at the beginning of the eleventh century. That more than one artist was involved in carving the ivories can be seen by comparing this panel with the other one in the Louvre, which depicts the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes.The Magdeburg Ivories combine influences from the Metz ivories of the second half of the ninth century (visible in the massive quality of the figures), with features characteristic of the Romanesque. The same synthesis can be seen in the late eleventh-century statuary of Toulouse, indicating the key role played by objets d'art as a source of inspiration to sculptors.

This shroud comes from a child's mummy. A child is portrayed in the center, inside a shrine coffin adorned with two columns and a pediment featuring a winged sun-disk and two uraeus cobras. The middle of the child's body is covered by a netting with geometric motifs resembling an architectural decor, surmounted by a winged scarab. The frame is composed of a garland of leaves and fruits. One end of the cloth has an openwork band terminating in a fringe.
A richly dressed child
This is a frontal representation of a child whose round head and shoulders stand out against a gray background. His white tunic is richly decorated with woven trim: clavii, neckband, medallions at the shoulders, double trim at the wrists, and rightangled strips at the hem. The tunic ends just above the ankles; the child's feet are clad in sandals. He wears many pieces of jewelry: a torque neck-ring with a bulla pendant, another necklace with a cylinder (for magical formulae with protective powers), a bracelet on each wrist, and two rings on his left hand. This jewelry (with the exception of the necklace) is in painted stucco. The boy's arms are bent in front of his chest; his right hand touches the bulla, his left holds the crown of justification. His elbows jut over the shrine coffin, creating an impression of depth. The middle of his body from waist to thigh is covered by a netting.The image of the child is placed inside a shrine coffin formed by two small columns and a pediment featuring the winged sun-disk. The columns, consisting of papyrus bundles (symbolizing regeneration), are painted in yellow and red.
Under the protection of the Egyptian gods
The vignettes down both sides of the shroud represent (from top to bottom, left to right): two bare-breasted mourners with ewers, painted in the Hellenistic style; Isis and Nephthys with their protective wings oustretched; the deceased portrayed alive, accompanied by Anubis (in a badly damaged vignette); Osiris, or the deceased as Osiris, flanked by two ankh signs; Anubis the embalmer (also badly damaged); Anubis carrying the mummy, with the key to the Underworld in his right hand; the scales for weighing the heart, with that of the mummy on one of the pans; Osiris the judge; a skull, two ankh signs and a snake; an edifice with four columns symbolizing the tent of purification.A black band with yellow nails frames each of these vignettes. The entire shroud is bordered by a garland of leaves and brightly colored petals, with a bunch of grapes at the top in the center.
Social status, and clues to dating the shroud
One clue to dating this shroud is the richly decorated Coptic-style tunic, which contrasts with the austere tunics (with clavii) of mummy portraits from the 1st and 2nd centuries. The oriental-influenced tunic came into fashion from the 3rd century, and was especially popular during the 4th century.The social status of the family is indicated by the quantity and richness of the jewelry, unusual for a child - but the round stucco pendant (or ""bulla"") and the cylindrical pendant containing prophylactic magical formulae were typical of children's jewelry.The painting technique is mixed, with encaustic for the face and bust, and tempera for the rest.As the shroud enveloped the child's mummy (af6492)*, the vignettes were placed down the sides. Once the shroud had been removed from the mummy it was stuck to a modern canvas; today it is presented like a painting.

This small stele has bas-reliefs sculpted on both sides. Dedicated by a vizier to Ramesses II, one side depicts the king in the pose of a child: seated, his finger to his lips, and a braid of hair falling to one side. On the other side, the vizier honors the god Ptah. This unusual image of Ramesses II as a child, who often boasted of winning the battle of Qadesh, still presents unanswered questions.
Two sides
Both sides of this small stele are sculpted. On the front, the royal child is none other than the conqueror Ramesses II, identified by the royal cartouche. He is depicted in the traditional pose of a child, seated on a soft cushion, his finger to his lips, and his head bare except for a braid of hair falling to one side, and a uraeus wound around his head. On the reverse side, the vizier, whose name is missing, is identified as such by the garments denoting his function. His hands raised in prayer, he honors the god Ptah. This god is housed in a small aedicule, or miniature temple. His body is entirely sheathed. His hair forms a skullcap and his beard is straight. He has a collar and he holds a composite scepter in both hands. 
Gods of creation
The two sides of this votive monument are linked in a subtle way. The cushion on the side bearing the king to whom the monument is dedicated reproduces the hieroglyphic sign of the akhet, or horizon [the sun rising between two mountain peaks]. It is a reminder that the divine child can be compared to the primordial being that is being born: the ""chosen of Ra"" is ""similar to the Sun"" that rises on the horizon. This is Ra, the creative force that is incarnated in the figure of the king.The other side depicts the god Ptah of Memphis, the Egyptian capital as early as the Old Kingdom. Ramesses II was extremely attached to this city and paid special tribute to Ptah, the Great Craftsman. According to the theology of the antique capital, Ptah could bring forth life through thought and words. Ramesses II therefore encouraged representations of the creator gods, as in his famous stone temple of Abu Simbel.

Ramesses, the eternal child
The image of the child-king seems to have been copied from an earlier sculpture. The style is similar to that of images of the princesses from the court of Amenophis IV, featuring slender fingers, a bent index finger, beaded earrings, a profile pose, and a large pleated loincloth that rises up the back. This recurrent theme is not a real portrait of youth, and it appears on several gold cornelian amulets. Ramesses II created a manifesto of sorts by having himself represented in this way, crouching between the claws of a colossal falcon (Cairo Museum). During the sixty-seven years of his reign - one of the longest in the history of Egypt - Ramesses II had to revive the eternal youth of his realm through jubilees, as the vitality of Egypt depended on it.

This crippled Neapolitan beggar is holding a paper authorizing him to beg, which reads in Latin: ""Give me alms for the love of God."" He takes pride in having his portrait painted by the artist and his picture indeed has the monumental size and dignity of a prince's likeness. He stands against a clear and luminous sky, a token of Ribera's evolution during his period of maturity under the influence of the masters of Bologna.

In a landscape with vast skies overhead stands a beggar with a clubfoot (a deformed foot, which no longer rests on the heel). In all likelihood a dwarf - as implied by the painting's title before it entered the collections of the Louvre, The Dwarf - he faces the viewer with a gap-toothed grin. His crutch slung over his shoulder like a weapon as if to amuse the spectator, he seems proud to have caught people's attention. In his hand, he also holds a paper on which the following line is inscribed in Latin: ""Give me alms for the love of God."" This is to inform us not that he is mute, but that he has the right to beg. Such a paper was a sort of permit required of beggars in Naples. Some have interpreted these lines as an appeal to Christian charity in the spirit of the Counter Reformation, which liked to recall the necessity of practicing acts of mercy. It is probable, however, that Ribera's main intention here was simply to paint the portrait of a beggar. He had a fancy for humble figures from the poorer populace, like Caravaggio before him. He also shared with his fellow countryman Velázquez a more specific interest in cripples and dwarfs.
A commission from a Flemish dealer
Ribera painted this picture in Naples in 1642. Contrary to long-standing belief, it appears not to have been commissioned by the viceroy of Naples, Duke of Medina de las Torres, but by a Flemish dealer. Flemish painters had accustomed their countrymen to representations of beggars (The Beggars by Brueghel the Elder, Louvre, r.f.730) and Flemish dealers ordered paintings of this kind from other Spanish artists as well, particularly from Murillo (The Young Beggar, Louvre, Inv.933). Born in the region of Valencia, Ribera left Spain for Italy very early. He resided at first in Rome, where he took up with the followers of Caravaggio. In 1616, he settled in Naples where he stayed until his death in 1652. Very soon, he became the town's most sought-after painter, concentrating on religious compositions in which he attached great importance to the representation of old and ailing bodies.
Luminosity and monumentality
This piece belongs to the period of Ribera's maturity during which he evolved from a Caravaggesque tenebrism to a luminous style under the influence of the masters of Bologna (Annibale Carraccio, Guido Reni) and of Venice (Titian). In this full-length portrait of a beggar, he has presented his subject close up and from a low angle so as to endow him with dignity and make him appear monumental. He would not have painted a king or a saint any differently. As in the period when he was influenced by Caravaggio, Ribera chose here to bring out the plasticity of forms by contrasting shadow and light on the face and hands. However, the beggar stands againt a backdrop that is no longer the dark background of the Spanish painter's earlier pictures, but a landscape over which a bright sky unfolds. The canvas is filled with an almost natural light. Contrasting with the vibrant blue of the sky, the figure of the beggar is painted with a limited palette of muted colors. Ribera's brushwork is loose.

191,Children,"Sainte Anne, la Vierge et lEnfant jouant avec un agneau, dite La Sainte Anne.",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/virgin-and-child-saint-anne?selection=44882,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-sainte-anne-vierge-l%C2%92enfant.jpg?1527820875,"

Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus – three generations, two the fruit of immaculate conception – are portrayed in a landscape. The picture was very probably commissioned as an ex-voto to Saint Anne in gratitude for the birth of Louis XII’s daughter, but Leonardo worked too long on the picture to deliver it. The composition is a fine example of his experimentation with figure composition and greatly inspired artists of the following generation.

	The little-known circumstances of a prestigious acquisition

	The picture is thought to have been commissioned by Louis XII of France to celebrate the birth of his only daughter, Claude, in 1499 – Anne was the name of his wife and of the patron saint of infertile and pregnant women. But the picture was never delivered to Louis XII since an observer noted its presence in Leonardo’s workshop in 1517 – the artist was then lodged by François I at Cloux, near Amboise. The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne’s reported presence in the Palais Cardinal (the present-day Palais Royal) in 1651 has fuelled the hypothesis that the picture entered the royal collection via Richelieu’s ministrations. But in all likelihood it was François I who acquired it from Leonardo’s assistant, Salai, for a considerable sum recorded in archives. However, prior to Le Brun’s 1683 inventory, no record of such a picture at the Château de Fontainebleau confirms this.

	The symbiosis of form and meaning

	Several preparatory works – the cartoon in the National Gallery in London and several drawings including the one in the Louvre (RF 460) – retrace the work’s gradual development. Leonardo replaced the young Saint John the Baptist in the first sketch by a symbol, the Lamb of God, and slid the Infant Jesus off his mother’s knees towards the ground. He gave more importance to Saint Anne, who becomes the axis of a triangular composition. The figures’ natural gestures interlock with one another: Anne’s right arm blends with Mary’s, whose head conceals her mother’s shoulder, and Mary’s left arm is prolonged by Christ’s. This interplay conveys meaning: the idea of lineage and the Incarnation of Christ, whose destiny, the Passion, is foreshadowed by the Lamb at the precipice’s edge. Leonardo’s originality here lies in his iconography (the addition of the Lamb) and his geometric yet dynamic composition.

	A fascinating and typically “Leonardesque” composition

	As he did in The Virgin of the Rocks, Leonardo set a religious scene in a fantastic landscape and placed an abyss between viewer and figures. The mountainous distance is conveyed by atmospheric perspective with bluish and crystalline highlights and reflects his interest in geology and meteorological phenomena.
	The sfumato, Leonardo’s trademark painterly effect, unifies the composition by enveloping the figures and landscape in a diffuse, evanescent and poetic haze. This imbues the highly expressive faces with great gentleness. The work exudes an aura of strangeness which, combined with the subtle expressions and the picture’s unfinished state has given rise to a number of psychoanalytical interpretations since Freud.
	The picture decisively influenced subsequent generations of artists, both classically-inspired painters such as Raphael and Solario, and Mannerists such as Andrea del Sarto (Charity, INV 712).

Leonardo’s emblematic and complexly symbolic The Virgin of the Rocks celebrates the mystery of Incarnation in portrayals of the Virgin Mary, Christ and Saint John the Baptist. For the first time, these holy figures, bathed in a gentle light, are set in rocky landscape. The many contemporary copies of the picture attest to the immense popularity of this new vision of the theme.
A complex history
The Louvre version of the picture was to have been the central part of a polyptych which the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception commissioned Leonardo and the de Predis brothers to paint for a chapel in the church of San Francesco Grande in Milan in 1483. The other version, now in the National Gallery in London and known to have formerly been in this chapel, and several archive documents indicate that the Louvre painting was never installed there. Its presence in the French royal collection is attested from1627, but several clues suggest it may have been acquired much earlier.
The most convincing hypothesis is that the picture, painted between 1483 and 1486, did not meet with Leonardo’s clients’ full satisfaction, which enabled Louis XII to acquire it around 1500−1503. The second, replacement picture, now in London, may have been painted by Ambrogio de Predis under Leonardo’s supervision between 1495 and 1508.
Ambiguous iconography
Comparison of the two versions of The Virgin of the Rocks clearly shows the ambiguous iconography of the first, about which much has been written. The identity of the figures may indeed appear unclear due to the absence of attributes and the pre-eminence of the infant Saint John, placed alongside the Virgin Mary, indicated by the archangel Gabriel’s pointing finger and Jesus’s sign of blessing. The desert in which the meeting between the two immaculately conceived children is traditionally depicted has been replaced by a supernatural rocky grotto, water and plants. The mystery of the Incarnation is celebrated by the role of Mary and the precursor John, who in Florentine tradition was one of Jesus’s childhood playmates and already aware of his future sacrifice for mankind. This prefiguration of Christ’s Passion seems to be echoed by the precipice on the edge of which the Infant Jesus is sitting and the vegetation surrounding him (aconite, palms, iris).
A totally innovative composition
The Virgin of the Rocks is the first picture Leonardo is known to have produced in Milan and has stylistic similarities with works painted towards the end of his stay in Florence such as The Adoration of the Magi (Florence) and Saint Jerome (Rome), whose aesthetic concepts it develops. The rigorously ordered pyramidal composition does not hinder the movement of the figures, and the painstaking orchestration of their gestures (the superimposition of hands and interplay of looks) takes on a new intensity in the diffuse light which softens outlines without weakening the modeling of the figures. 
The figures’ natural poses and the omnipresence of the predominantly mineral landscape are highly innovative compared to the affected architecture and hieratic poses of the altarpieces of the period. Yet it was not until 1501, when the cartoon of Saint Anne was first shown in Florence (see INV 776) that these principles were put into practice by other artists.

This drawing is an example of one aspect of Fragonard's highly varied oeuvre: childhood scenes. The artist's humor and sense of observation make this a particularly pleasing version of a subject that he also painted. Shown in Paris in 1779, the canvas has since been lost, but the drawing and an engraving he made with Marguerite Gérard help preserve its memory.      
Fragonard, painter and father
Under the light touches of brown wash, the black chalk sketch shows through clearly: a few fine, supple lines thrown onto the page have sufficed to establish a composition in which a child leans against a column, holding in his arms a cat he has wrapped up as if it were a doll. The cat's pose - eyes closed, legs stretched out stiffly - speaks volumes about its discomfort and discomfiture as two dogs prowl nearby. Emerging from behind the column, a second child seems to be enjoying the scene enormously. Fragonard had two children, Rosalie and Evariste (later a famous painter in his own right), and may have drawn on their games for this humorous scene. 
Master and pupil
This drawing is dated to late 1777 or the very beginning of 1778, and must have been used for the extremely rare etching bearing the caption ""first plate by Mademoiselle Gérard, aged 16. 1778."" Born on January 24, 1761, Marguerite Gérard was Fragonard's sister-in-law; sixteen years younger than Marie-Anne, the artist's wife, Marguerite joined the couple in Paris around 1775. She was the only pupil Fragonard ever had and probably executed some of her youthful works with the master, the etching after the Wrapped-up Cat being doubtless among them. At the Salon de la Correspondance in the following year, Fragonard showed a painting whose description tallies perfectly with the subject of this drawing. The canvas was much appreciated by the critics, who admired ""the sheer beauty of the colors, in the lively Rubens manner."" 
Fragonard, painter of childhood
Children were dear to Fragonard's heart, and he often took them as subjects for his drawings and paintings. This example reveals an acute sense of observation allied to a real understanding of his models and their postures. The tenderness and, even more so, the humor that permeate these works set him apart from his contemporaries: we are a long way from de Greuze and his moralizing. There is another Fragonard drawing in the Louvre, in red chalk, of a child sitting on a chair with a cat curled up by his feet.

The Young Beggar is often called The Lice-Ridden Boy because he is delousing himself. The picture is the first known depiction of a street urchin in Murillo's work. The painting was undoubtedly inspired by the rampant misery in the streets of Seville during the Golden Age. Influenced by Caravaggism, Murillo dwells on sordid details and uses stark contrasts of light and shade. Yet the boy also has the gracefulness that is the Sevillian master's hallmark. 
A Sevillian picaro
A young boy dressed in rags, with dirty feet, is sitting alone in a corner of some decrepit building. He appears to be busy delousing himself, hence the picture's other title: The Lice-Ridden Boy. Next to him, a pitcher, a basket of apples and the remains of a meal of a few shrimps. This is the first picture by Bartolomé Estebán Murillo depicting a street urchin, a subject he subsequently painted throughout his career. His compatriots Velázquez and Ribera had already taken up the theme, but had preferred to paint disabled subjects (Ribera's The Club-Footed Boy, Musée du Louvre). Yet despite the picture's title, the boy is perhaps not a beggar. In painting the misery of homeless children in Seville during the Golden Age, Murillo was undoubtedly also attempting to create colorful counterparts to the famous characters of Spanish picaresque literature, Lazarillo de Tormes (1511), and the picaro in Cervantès' Exemplary Novels (1613).  
A genre painting by a great religious painter
It has been suggested that Flemish merchants living in Seville may have commissioned this genre picture by Murillo. Genre painting, which depicts daily life, was greatly appreciated in Flanders, and the poor were a recurrent subject in Flemish genre painting. Murillo's interest in the needy perhaps also has something to do with the doctrine of charity of the Franciscans, for whom he frequently worked. Murillo, the last of the great painters of Spain's Golden Age, was above all a religious painter. For the Franciscans of Seville he painted a cycle of pictures to which The Angels' Kitchen (Musée du Louvre) belongs.  
An elegant Caravaggism
In this early work, no doubt painted around 1645-50, we see the influence of Caravaggism, which Murillo may have discovered in the works of Zurbarán and in the Sevillian pictures of Velázquez. Like his predecessors, Murillo was intent on depicting the sordid details, the boy's dirtiness, and the still life motifs (""bodegones"") of the basket and pitcher. He also used their harsh chiaroscuro. A beam of sunlight spotlights the child sitting in a shady interior. Substances - the woven straw of the basket, for instance - are rendered in broad brushstrokes and thick impasto. But here Murillo also shows his sense of harmony in the perfect composition and the young boy's graceful pose and physique. The child's profound dignity differentiates him from the truculent figures of Flemish genre scenes. Murillo subsequently gravitated towards a less austere, gentler and more tender style (The Holy Family, Musée du Louvre).

The first terra-cotta figurines appeared in Cyprus during the Chalcolithic period (3000-2300 BC). In the Early Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC), they took the form of flat clay plaques with incised decoration. In the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1600 BC), they begin to show evidence of modeling and to diversify in form with the appearance of women carrying children, who represented concepts such as femininity, maternity, and child care.
A mother and child
This female figurine resembles the plank figurines of the preceding period, but now the arms and breasts are rendered in relief. The woman holds in her arms a swaddled infant on a hooped cradleboard. These cradleboards are characteristic of a particular school of Cypriot art, although they were also produced on other isolated occasions. The infant's head is always by the mother's left breast. Her thick neck is not clearly differentiated from the head, which has a nose in relief, holes for eyes, and large ears apparently pierced for earrings. The incised lines between neck and bosom may represent necklaces, while marks behind the right shoulder perhaps suggest clothing. An identical female figure with a child in her arms adorns the shoulder of a jug from Cyprus in the Louvre collection. Both seem intended as representations of maternity.
Female figurines in Cyprus
Although their precise origins are often unknown, the Louvre series of these female figures, which first make their appearance in the Chalcolithic period (3000-2300 BC), is of great interest. The necropolis at Vounous yielded numerous examples for the Early Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC). In the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, these figurines were made by hand and often covered in polished red slip; they were sometimes decorated with incised or relief motifs, the technique giving its name to what is called Red Polished Ware. In the Middle Bronze Age, the schematic forms of these rectangular plank-shaped figures progress towards a certain realism: the legs and arms are modeled, while the body takes on a certain thickness. The female figures bearing children in their arms date from this period, as do the figures of infants alone in their cradle. These figurines, which become more numerous in the Late Bronze Age (1600-1050 BC), are probably expressions of the idea of fertility.

This young fisher boy with infectious good humor is a landmark in the history of art. François Rude shook the foundations of conventional classicism by the ingenuousness of his subject and his non-idealized representation of nature. The boy's gracefulness undoubtedly ensured the success of the work, which inspired several artists, particularly Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.
A Romantic manifesto
This cheerful boy, playing with a tortoise held captive by a reed, caused heated controversy at the Salon of 1833. For the first time, an artist had sculpted a lifesize marble of a picturesque figure, an anecdotal subject. It marked a complete break with classical ideology, whereby genre scenes were considered to be unworthy of statuary art, especially in a medium as noble as marble. Rude's theme and style also contradicted classical canons. Although reminiscent of antique sculpture, the work was imbued with an unprecedented feeling of freedom and freshness. The boy is naked like the heroes of mythology, but his body is not idealized and his hearty laugh reveals his teeth, a real breach of good taste. The tradition of representing children at play did exist in Hellenistic sculpture, but Rude emphasized the popular, lively aspect of his depiction. The child seated on a net is a young fisher boy, whose bonnet and scapular (the devotional object around his neck) show that he is from Naples. His attitude is carefree and his entire face - crinkled eyes, dimples, open mouth - is laughing.
The Italian picturesque
In the wake of Mme de Staël's novel Corinne, or Italy (1807), picturesque figures of country people and fishermen became for poets and artists the embodiment of simple, innocent nature, while southern Italy was regarded as its last surviving refuge. Rude, who had never visited Italy, may have drawn his inspiration from scenes of Italian folklore by the Swiss painter Léopold Robert (1794-1835). With his plaster model, executed in 1829 and shown at the Salon of 1831, the sculptor inaugurated a theme destined to be hugely successful. At the Salon of 1833, Francisque Duret (1804-1865) showed a nimble, playful Neapolitan Fisher Boy Dancing the Tarantella (Louvre). Among the many subsequent interpretations was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's outstanding Young Fisherman with Shell (Orsay, original plaster model at the Louvre). Its execution dates to the artist's first visit to Rome, where he ordered a cast of the face of Rude's Fisher Boy to be sent. Through the child's grace, naïveté, and carefree cheerfulness, Carpeaux paid a vibrant tribute to his master.
Recognition of a mature artist
Despite the objections raised by conservative critics such as Gustave Planche, Young Neapolitan Fisher Boy was a huge success. It was purchased by Louis-Philippe's administration for the Musée du Luxembourg, reserved for the works of living artists. It was the first time the State had bought a work by the sculptor, then aged forty-nine. That same year, Rude was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and he received the commission for his best-known work, The Departure of the Volunteers of 1792, also known as La Marseillaise, one of the four high reliefs on the Arc de Triomphe, in the Place de l'Étoile, Paris (plaster model of the head now at the Louvre).

Admission piece for the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, presented on 24 September 1689. The earliest series of admission pieces consists of religious subjects, especially figures of apostles such as this one.
A bas-relief of a single figure
Saint James the Less was Jesus' cousin and one of the twelve apostles. After Saint Peter left for Rome, he became the head of the Christian Church in Palestine. In 62 the Sanhedrin took advantage of the absence of the Roman procurator to sentence him to be stoned to death. He was killed by a blow from a fulling stick, which smashed his skull. The saint is represented here in profile, reading a parchment. In his right hand he holds a fulling stick, the instrument with which he was killed.This bas-relief was the admission piece that Jean-Jacques Clérion submitted  to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 24 September 1689, two years after the approval of the model in 1687. Although the bas-relief is limited to one figure, the sculptor set out to demonstrate his mastery of his art: an academic nude, drapery, care taken over the details (hair, beard, stick), and differentiation of spatial planes to give the figure depth.
What is an admission piece?
An admission piece is the work an artist had to submit to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture to become a member. It was the equivalent of the sample of work master craftsmen had to submit to become members of a guild. For sculptors, article XIII of the Académie's 1663 statutes stipulates that it must be a marble bas-relief, and this remained largely the case until the late 17th century. Three main types can be distinguished: religious medallions (the case with Clérion's work), allegorical tableaus concerning the Académie, and allegorical scenes in honor of Louis XIV. There are a few notable exceptions, though: expressive heads, a few portraits, and an in-the-round statuette, Corneille Van Cleve's Polyphemus Sitting on a Rock (1681).
Admission to the Académie
A sculptor wishing to become a member of the Académie first had to have his work approved. The candidate brought several of his works, in plaster or terracotta. If this presentation was approved, by secret vote, the director of the Académie then indicated the subject the artist had to execute for his marble admission piece, within a set time limit.

This group, cast using the lost-wax method (in which a model is first made of wax, then enclosed in a clay and plaster mold), shows a bishop sitting on a throne removing a thorn from the paw of a little lion, who watches him intently. The scene is an apocryphal episode from the life of one of the Christian Fathers, St Jerome, and is attributed to the Paduan sculptor Bartolomeo Bellano (circa 1437-96), a pupil and successor of Donatello. This is the only known version of the group.
The subject
St Jerome (AD 347-420) was one of the four great doctors of the Christian Latin Church. Born in Stridon on the Dalmatian border (near modern Ljubljana) he studied in Rome and was commissioned by Pope St Damasus I to revise the Old Latin Gospels, in reference to reliable Greek translations from the original Hebrew (the Septuagint). On earlier travels in the Middle East, Jerome is also thought to have studied a Hebrew Gospel, purported to be the original Gospel of St Matthew. Jacobus de Voragine's apocryphal thirteenth-century account of the lives of Christ and the Christian saints, the Golden Legend, tells how St Jerome interrupted a learned discussion of the Bible with members of his monastic community to remove a thorn from the foot of an injured lion. Jacobus in fact confused this episode with one from the life the Greek Orthodox saint Gerasimos, a fifth-century hermit in Palestine.
A compact sculptural group
This compact group is composed around a pyramid structure. At the saint's feet can be seen a book, recalling his extensive writings on the Bible, and a cardinal's hat, an allusion to his traditional role as one of the Christian church's Latin Fathers (his highest official ecclesiastical rank  was in fact a spell as secretary to Pope St Damasus I). The lion's mane shows it to be a mature animal, albeit represented here as the size of a small dog. Man and beast gaze intently at one another. The modeling of Jerome's simple robes, clearly made from coarse, heavy fabric, reinforces the direct, humane character of the group.
Bartolomeo Bellano: a sculptor of the Paduan school
The group is attributed to Bartolomeo Bellano, a Paduan sculptor who was a pupil and successor of Donatello (the creator of the celebrated bronze high altar in the church of San Antonio in Padua, known as the Santo). The attribution to Bellano is based on stylistic comparisons with reliefs executed for his monument to Pietro Roccabonella (1491-94, in the church of San Francesco in Padua). The reliefs are still in situ, but the monument was completed by Andrea Riccio in 1498, after Bellano's death, and has not survived in its original form. Vasari notes that Bellano created a number of small-scale works in marble and bronze for Pope Paul II. The present group may well be one of these.

Patinir and the landscape
One of the key events in late-15th-century painting was the emergence in the Netherlands of a new genre that would become very popular: the landscape. Patinir of Antwerp was the first artist to be described as a ""landscape painter,"" and Dürer himself used this term in connection with his work. The painting in the Louvre contains all of the characteristic elements of Patinir's landscapes: an expansive view taking in undulating plains, rocks, and a river, all of which are unified by a subtle spectrum of blue-green hues. Depth is suggested by the superposition of backgrounds marked by clearer and clearer colors further back (atmospheric perspective). This technique would be taken up in the 16th century by painters such as Paul Bril and Joos de Momper, and later would be introduced into Italy. The most frequently employed composition involves a dark foreground with a lighter background of green tones and a blue ground.
Saint Jerome
Saint Jerome is, along with Saint Gregory the Great, Saint Augustine, and Saint Ambrose, one of the four doctors of the Church. He was born around 340 at Stridon on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia. He was educated in Rome under the tutelage of the famous grammarian Donatus. After being baptized, he undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He then retired into the desert in Syria to pay penitence and to live as a hermit. Upon returning to Rome in 382, he was commissioned by Pope Damasus to translate the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek into Latin (the Vulgate). The translation was completed in Palestine, where the saint retired after the death of the pope. He died in 420. He is the patron saint of theologians and scholars.
Between a religious painting and an anecdotal scene
The painting shows Saint Jerome sheltering under a makeshift hut during his retreat in the desert. He is dressed in a gray tunic, the color of humility, and stands near a dead tree, a symbol of the soul tainted with sin. A cardinal's habits lie at the foot of the tree. Anecdotal figures and details, such as the dog to the left watching a bird in flight, several other animals, and the little village to the right, add life to the composition. The landscape, to which a purely aesthetic value is too often attributed, contributes to the religious message of the painting in that it represents the most obvious manifestation of divine creation.

Saint Joseph, the patron of carpenters, is working on a beam before the Infant Jesus who already appears to see in it the wood of his cross.
The story of a gift from London to Paris
The painting appeared in 1938, shortly after the spectacular rediscovery of the work of Georges de La Tour. At the time it belonged to Percy Moore Turner, a great English merchant who offered the work to London’s National Gallery, which failed to raise the necessary funds. The painting remained with its owner who donated it to the Louvre in 1948 in memory of his friend Paul Jamot, the former chief curator of the department of Paintings, who passed away in 1939. Ever since, it has featured among the artist’s most admired works. 
A flame in the carpenter’s workshop
A descendant of the house of David, Joseph, husband of Mary and “foster father” to Christ, was a carpenter in Jerusalem. The worship of Joseph enjoyed a great revival from the 16th century thanks to the Jesuits, the Franciscans, and Saint Teresa of Ávila, who reformed the Carmelite Order. Here the carpenter is leaning forward, busy drilling a piece of wood with an auger, to the light of a candle held by Christ whose face is radiant in the large flame. The arrangement of pieces of wood on the floor evokes a cross and prefigures Christ’s sacrifice. These elements refer to three devotions that were particularly important in Lorraine in the 17th century through the impetus of the Franciscans: Saint Joseph, the Infant Jesus, and the Cross.
A purple passage
The technique, as well as the emotion exuding from the image, makes this painting a true purple passage. The painter compares the uncouth, imposing physique of the old man and his anxious gaze with that of the child, thereby highlighting the latter’s purity. This contrast is enhanced by the strong light reflected on Christ’s face that in turn appears to light up the room. A similar process frequently recurs in the work of Georges de La Tour to indicate a divine presence in a scene taken from everyday life and portrayed with veracity. The resultant effect is both highly restrained and one of striking visual impact. Moreover, the painter reveals the measure of his talent in astonishing details such as the candlelight traversing the child’s hand or the fine still life in the foreground made up of a tool and a wood shaving.

This unusual nude figure represents saint Mary Magdalene as a mystic ascetic. According to legend, the repentant sinner lived a secluded life in the cave of Sainte-Baume, clothed only by her hair. Every day she was raised up in the sky by angels to hear the heavenly chorus. The statue appeared on the German art market in the 19th century and was purchased by the Louvre in 1902.

	A statue seen in the round

	The saint was originally held up by carved angels. Encased in an oval metal structure, the wooden statue was suspended from the vault of a church, perhaps the church of saint Mary Magdalene in the Dominican convent of Augsburg, which was rebuilt in 1513-15. It must have been seen in the round, since the back is as carefully carved and colored as the front. The statue was later taken down and the angels were removed.

	Between Gothic and Renaissance

	This Mary Magdalene is attributed to Gregor Erhart through comparison with the Virgin of Mercy of Kaisheim carved by the sculptor in 1502-03 (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, destroyed in 1945). Trained in Ulm, in Swabia, by his father Michael Erhart (mentioned in Ulm from 1469 to 1522), Gregor moved to Augsburg in 1494 where he became an important master sculptor. The generous, refined style of Saint Mary Magdalene, her peaceful grace and gentle face are indeed part of the Swabian late-Gothic tradition. But the thrusting hip, which suggests a classical contrapposto, the harmonious proportions, and the fullness of the naked female body reveal knowledge of Dürer's work and a search for formal beauty that is specific to the Renaissance. Gregor Erhart's genius was to interpret the traditional image of the saint being carried to heaven by angels in an unprecedented manner in sculpture. Far from the Gothic convention of a thin, unreal figure, he reveals feminine curves, scarcely hidden by the rippling mane of golden hair which flows over her shoulders and spreads across her back. The modeling of the body - the slight hollows of tensed muscles and faint grooves on the fleshy parts - shows great sensitivity. The beauty of the face, with its firm regular features chiseled from the lime wood with great subtlety, is accentuated by the original polychromy, which is pale and very refined in the Gothic tradition.

	Sensual but idealized

	The carnal presence of this life-sized statue must have been very imposing in the church. But the sensual, almost profane image that it offers today, bereft of its carved angels, should be tempered. The languid pose and the meditative expression are intended to convey the penitent's mystic ecstasy, while her marvelous beauty and glossy golden locks are meant to evoke her holy radiance. The conception of this female nude is thus in phase with the spiritual content of the religious image, idealized in the medieval tradition. Gregor Erhart here produced his masterpiece, a brilliant creation of Nordic humanism in the late Middle Ages, on the threshold of the Renaissance.

Saint Michael Overwhelming the Demon may have been painted for Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, around 1503−1505, at the same time as Saint George and the Dragon (INV. 609), with which it has always been associated.
From Apocalypse to Divine Comedy
In the Apocalypse of Saint John (Book of Revelation), the Archangel Michael, having overcome the rebel angels, slays the dragon, an allegorical embodiment of evil, and casts it to earth. In this depiction, Raphael enriched the scene’s traditional representation with ancillary scenes inspired by the Inferno in the Divine Comedy, in which Dante recounts the punishment of hypocrites and thieves. On the left, the hypocrites, shrouded in gilded lead cloaks, are emerging from the ground and parading before the burning city, while on the right the naked thieves are at being devoured by snakes and black birds.
A text admired at the court of Urbino
Dante’s Inferno was greatly admired at the court of Urbino, and Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, or possibly his sister, Giovanna Feltria della Rovere, eager to celebrate her son Francesco Maria della Rovere’s admission to the Order of Saint Michael in 1503, could have commissioned this picture. Its companion piece, a portrayal of Saint George, also in the Louvre, is very similar to another depiction of the same theme clearly linked to the Duke of Urbino’s patronage. Saint Michael’s shield, decorated with a red cross on a white ground, has so far been seen solely an allusion to the cross of Saint Michael, knight of Christ.
A strong northern European influence
This work is typical of a series of very small pictures Raphael painted around 1503−1505, when he was dividing his time between Perugia and Urbino. The influence of Perugino, discernable here in the lanky, dancing figure of Saint Michael, is combined with a strong debt to northern European painting, particularly Memling but also – herein lies the painting’s originality – Hieronymus Bosch. The latter had very probably stayed in Venice around 1500 and his phantasmagorical creatures belonging to a totally imaginary, subterranean world and artificial light effects also fascinated Italian painters. Raphael was one of the first to be inspired by him, as shown here by the ghoulish figures Saint Michael is fighting and the landscape itself.

The picture was formerly in the church at Aigueperse in Auvergne. It was taken there after being offered in 1481 as a wedding gift to the daughter of Mantegna’s patron, Federico Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, and Gilbert de Bourbon, Count of Montpensier. The painting reflects Mantegna’s fascination for antiquity and illustrates his skill in perspective effects: the monumentality of the body of the martyred saint is heightened by the viewer’s upward-looking viewpoint.

	A work of religious devotion

	The worship of Saint Sebastian, protector against the plague, was widespread in the 15th century. Mantegna broke with traditional iconography by introducing references to antiquity. Encouraged by his teacher Squarcione and his contacts in Paduan humanist circles, he threw himself passionately into the rediscovery of antiquity. Yet his precise archaeological references in no way trammel his inventiveness, as illustrated by the column’s composite capital and the fanciful architecture in the landscape. The mixture of architectural styles expresses the continuity between the antique and Christian worlds, a theme dear to the humanists. Yet this is still a devotional work: the sculpted foot next to the saint’s feet symbolizes the triumph of Christianity over paganism via sacrifice, and the arrow-riddled body, although treated in the antique style, remains faithful to iconographic tradition.

	Obsession with detail

	The picture shows Mantegna’s perfectionist love of detail, which gave his work its admirably finished appearance but entailed slow, painstaking work. This could indicate the influence of Flemish painting, examples of which Mantegna may have seen in Ferrara as a young man. Although the use of oil paint was spreading, Mantegna preferred tempera on canvas, a refined technique whose matt effects are similar to fresco and enhance his incisive drawing, and whose opacity accentuates forms and the severity of the color. The result is close to etching, which Mantegna practiced between 1470 and 1485. The mineral coldness of the forms also evokes sculpture, the major art of the Renaissance, and Squarcione reproached his former pupil because “his paintings did not resemble living models but antique statues”. Late in life, Mantegna took this technique to the extreme by painting trompe-l’œil pictures of antique bas-reliefs.

	The art of trompe l'oeil

	Mantegna demonstrated his mastery of trompe l’œil in his depictions of architecture and sculpture (his oculus in the Camera degli Sposi in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua). He used this painterly artifice here by adding a porphyry frame, acting as an imaginary window onto the picture space. In doing so, he was evoking the theory discussed by Alberti in his De Pictura (1435), according to which the painting is a window on reality. The two executioners, daringly cut off below the shoulders, enhance this illusionist effect, which Mantegna used in other works, including The Crucifixion (INV 368). The viewer is invited to place himself at the same height as the archers, thus adopting their point of view and humbling himself before the sculptural body of the saint towering above him. The very low vanishing point, upward-looking viewpoint and masterful foreshortening imbue the martyr with a solemn monumentality.

A complex, multi-faceted artist who easily absorbed visual experience, Giordano is revealed often to have been an inspired draftsman. The composition and graphic aspects of this drawing of St. Cecilia playing the organ indicate it was completed early in Giordano's career, when he was still very much influenced by his master Jusepe de Ribera (1591-1652). HIs brilliant calligraphic style exploits all the effects possible with brown wash.
The master Ribera
Giordano was famed in his day for his skill in making the style of his illustrious masters his own, although his own touch is immediately recognizable. He tried to minimize the role of drawing, but his exceptional talent in this field shone through. The style of this early drawing, as well as that of a Martyrdom of St. Sebastian, also in the Louvre, is identical to that of a study in the Villa Farnesina in Rome for the painting Jesus among the Doctors (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome), whose date may be between 1657 and 1660. The freshness of Ribera's influence can be seen in the use of fragmented lines and in the positioning of all the figures in the same plane of perspective. Giordano brought to his drawings a sense of scale and a pictorial sensibility that are his own, which may be seen in a comparison of two refined, detailed studies in the Louvre - Moses drawing water from the rock and Samson and Delilah - with drawings by Ribera.
. . . and Rosa and Cambiaso . . .
Evoking the Neapolitan artistic ambiance of the second half of the 17th century, this drawing, as well as Giordano's Susannah and the Elders (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples), also echoes the graphic work of Salvator Rosa, particularly his Woman playing a Lute (Teylers Museum, Haarlem), in the broad, free, sweeping lines that scorn formal construction and painstaking accuracy. His style also came under the influence of the Genoese artist Luca Cambiaso. Literary sources indicate that in his youth, Giordano practiced copying Cambiaso's works. This is corroborated by a fragment of a letter dated 1687, written on the reverse of a drawing in Munich catalogued as an anonymous 17th-century work. The Genoese influence probably played an important part in helping Giordano break free from the shadow of his master Ribera; this contact, together with trips to Venice and Rome, helped Giordano develop a freer style.
Giordano the draftsman
Giordano the draftsman has a great deal in common with Giordano the painter. In both cases, he uses a wide variety of techniques, some unusual, such as the combination of pen for outlines and chalk to bulk out volumes. His drawings reveal a spontaneous temperament and are less the result of his research than the reflection of his impressions, thrown down vigorously on the page. He worked in several styles at a time and often returned to previous styles to give them another try. In the 1670s, his figures seemed to melt into their surroundings, which were filled with a new light. In both drawing and painting, he developed a more personal style from around 1680, which set him apart from other artists of the late 17th century. His art became more consistent: no drawings from this later period show the least sign of mediocrity or weakness.

Described in 1550 and 1568 by Vasari as being found in the church of San Francesco in Pisa, this retable no doubt comes from one of the transept chapels. Often contested despite the presence of the signature, the attribution of this work to Giotto has been reaffirmed by the majority of specialists. The scenes from the life of St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) are comparable to the frescoes depicting the same subject in the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi that are also attributed to Giotto.
A non-traditional representation
For the central portion of the painting, Giotto chose not to depict a full-length, hieratic figure, as one generally sees on 13th-century retables, but rather one of the key moments in the life of St. Francis: the receiving the stigmata of Christ, whom he sees in the form of a seraph while praying on Mount Alverno. The predella of the retable depicts four scenes from the life of the saint: to the left, the dream of Pope Innocent III wherein he sees St. Francis supporting a church about to collapse; in the center, the pope approving the rule of the Franciscan order; to the right, St. Francis preaching to the birds, demonstrating that the Word of God applies to all living creatures.
A work by Giotto
The four scenes are very similar in their iconography, composition, and style to the cycle of frescoes depicting the life of St. Francis in the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi, which the majority of experts attribute to Giotto. The presence of the painter's signature, OPUS IOCTI FLORENTINI, on the original frame leaves no doubt as to the authenticity of the retable and moreover confirms Giotto's intervention in the early 1390s at the building site of the basilica.
The renewal of Florentine painting
Here Giotto's innovative character is evident: the work is an unprecedented expression of artistic freedom. The main register, a historic scene in a landscape, is a lesson in the evolution of pictorial language, notably in the representation of space. The principal scene is particularly elaborate, as Giotto endeavors to depict an interior. The small chapels in three-quarter profile demonstrate a budding awareness of perspective. The artist poetically depicts the different species of birds that come to listen to the saint, while demonstrating his concern for drawing closer to reality. The image of Christ, still bearing many formal similarities to the sacred figures of Byzantine art, contrasts with that of St. Francis: the intense expression, the emotion in his gaze, but also the facial features modeled by effects of light, give him a real sense of humanity.A new world, solidly constructed, emerges from Giotto's brush. It is peopled with figures imbued with a new physical and expressive reality.

Painted retable, perhaps commissioned by the Gaddi family, for one of the altars of the monastery of San Domenico in Fiesole (near Florence), where the artist later served as prior. The studied perspective and the physicality of the figures attest to the influence of Masaccio on the young Fra Angelico.
The Coronation of the Virgin
Based on apocryphal texts, the Coronation theme was widely disseminated in the 13th century through Jacobus De Voragine's Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend). The episode follows the Assumption and describes the celestial welcome of the Virgin by Christ, who lifts her above the multitude of the blessed. By way of nine marble steps of various colors, the Virgin climbs to Christ's throne, where a place to His right has been reserved for her. Kneeling with her head bowed, the Virgin receives the crown from the hands of her Son in glory. They are surrounded by the heavenly host, composed of angel musicians and saints, some of whose names appear engraved on their respective haloes; others are identifiable by their attributes. In the foreground, from left to right: St. Louis of France with his fleur-de-lys crown; Mary Magdalene, in red with her hair loose and holding a vase of perfume; St. Catherine of Alexandria with the wheel of her martyrdom; and St. Agnes, holding a lamb to her breast.
A Dominican commission
Several Dominicans, the patrons of this work, are recognizable by their white robes and black mantles. St. Dominic appears in profile; he holds a lily and above his head shines a red star. The martyred St. Peter is depicted with a bleeding wound on his head. The theologian St. Thomas Aquinas is also present, holding his writings and pointing to the scene. On the predella are scenes referring to episodes in the life of the order's founder: The Dream of Innocent III, Saints Peter and Paul Appearing to St. Dominic, St. Dominic Restoring Napoleone Orsini, Christ in the Tomb, The Dispute of St. Dominic and the Miracle of the Book, St. Dominic and his Companions Fed by Angels, and The Death of St. Dominic.
Fra Angelico and his times
The composition is based on the pyramidal structure of the steps and the figures of the Virgin and Christ. The space has been determined according to the laws of linear perspective; these define the angle of the paving stones, which converge at a point above the vase of Mary Magdalene. The space is coherent, each figure placed in such a way that all can be seen. The sculptural volume of the bodies, whose monumentality is accentuated by the low point of view, is reminiscent of the works of Masaccio, which Fra Angelico had the opportunity to contemplate in Florence. Unlike Masaccio, however, Fra Angelico rejected idealized architecture in favor of an aedicula with Gothic forms. The delicate modeling of the faces was inspired by that of Gentile da Fabriano and the color scheme by the palette of Lorenzo Monaco.

This Sermon of John the Baptist, dated 1589, is a superb example of Hans Bol's work at this stage of his life. He was then famed for his miniatures representing lively landscape scenes drawn from antiquity or the Bible. His painstaking execution, careful attention to detail, and love of landscape painting are worthy of praise. Note the landscape in this work, which, although in the background, is nonetheless grandiose.
From scenes to landscapes
In the foreground on the left is the seated saint. The crowd clustering to hear him preach is depicted in great detail, indicating the artist's love of precise, meticulous description. This scene fills the entire foreground with a multitude of figures. The precise, colorful drawing is the heart of the composition. However, it does not entirely draw our attention away from the superb landscape in the background, which is equally elaborate. The importance given to this landscape, despite being in the background, is a sign of Bol's interest in depicting nature and also indicates the influence of the grandiose, panoramic alpine paintings of Pieter Breugel. The immensity of nature is figured by the river, which winds across the paper to the edge of the drawing. The trees, plentifully if irregularly dotting the foreground, reach to the top of the sheet, pulling the viewer's gaze to the background where a town lies in the distance, then on to the very low, almost infinitely distant horizon where lines and outlines blur and meld. Hans Bol also engraved a very different version of the same theme as part of a series of twelve circular landscapes.
An acknowledged master of the landscape
Hans Bol left his home town of Malines, where he joined the guild in 1560, for Antwerp, then Bergen-op-Zoom and later Dordrecht. He eventually settled in Amsterdam where he enjoyed a certain degree of influence. He drew a great deal, particularly for prints, working with Hieronymus Cock, who specialized in publishing engravings. He began his career with large tempera compositions but in 1567 decided to turn away from this technique, which was all too easy to copy. He chose instead a technique far more difficult to imitate, miniatures in oil on vellum. This work is a perfect illustration of this new style.
Miniatures for curiosity cabinets
This gouache is one of Hans Bol's late works. Twenty-six of these, dating from 1587 to 1592, are held in the Münchner Residenz, Munich. Eight others, dating from between 1580 and 1587, can be seen in the Dresden Gemäldegalerie, and two others are in the Worcester Art Museum. The refinement of the works, their small format, and the painstaking devotion to detail may indicate that these works were painted specifically for curiosity cabinets, which were common in Hans Bol's day.

This work belongs to a cycle of paintings devoted to the life of St. Stephen, created for the upper hall of the Scuola di Santo Stefano in Venice between 1511 and 1520. Three other paintings from the cycle are conserved in Berlin, Milan, and Stuttgart; the fifth has disappeared.
Staging the scene
The scene takes place within the walls of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. St. Stephen preaches from an ancient pedestal, partially in ruins, which symbolizes victory over paganism. Pointing his finger skyward, the saint invites his audience to contemplate God. In the foreground, a group of eastern women sit cross-legged on the ground, captivated by the sermon. Around them eastern men in turbans, Greeks - recognizable by their high hats (far left) - and westerners offer proof to the universality of the saint's message. The temple behind, a symbol of Judaism, is depicted as a ""tempio"" of the Italian Renaissance. On the hill of Jerusalem one can make out the church of the Holy Sepulchre. The city - which some historians have identified as Damascus - is rendered as a conglomerate of ancient buildings and minarets of a mineral-like austerity.
Rendering materials
Aside from the blue in the cupolas, the architecture is painted in tones of pearly white, occasionally tinted with ochre. In the background, a landscape of Italian hills lost in mist is somewhat evocative of the art of Leonardo da Vinci. A crowd of figures populates this world. The work makes evident Carpaccio's fondness for rendering materials - crimson velvets and brocade (on the saint's chasuble) - as well as a fascination for the Orient, which he shared with the other Venetian painters. The cycle of paintings is based on the theme of historical continuity between Judaism and Christianity. One of Carpaccio's later works, The Sermon makes use of a narrative vein that the artist himself had invented two decades earlier in the History of St. Ursula cycle, found today in the Academia museum in Venice.
A cycle devoted to St. Stephen
This painting, whose frame once bore the date 1514, is the second and most famous of the cycle that originally comprised ""The Consecration of the Host"" (Berlin), ""The Sermon"", ""The Judgement of St. Stephen"" (now missing), ""The Stoning of St. Stephen"" (Stuttgart), and the ""Disputation of St. Stephen"" (Milan). The episodes illustrate the life of the saint, such as it was related by Jacobus de Voragine in Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend, 1264). Commissioned in 1511 and completed in 1520, the cycle was meant to decorate the chapel - ""albergo"" - of a Venetian devotional brotherhood called the Scuola de Santo Stefano. The majority of the members were stonecutters for whom Stephen - martyred by stoning - was patron saint; this also helps to explain the omnipresence of stone architecture in the painting.

Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus – three generations, two the fruit of immaculate conception – are portrayed in a landscape. The picture was very probably commissioned as an ex-voto to Saint Anne in gratitude for the birth of Louis XII’s daughter, but Leonardo worked too long on the picture to deliver it. The composition is a fine example of his experimentation with figure composition and greatly inspired artists of the following generation.

	The little-known circumstances of a prestigious acquisition

	The picture is thought to have been commissioned by Louis XII of France to celebrate the birth of his only daughter, Claude, in 1499 – Anne was the name of his wife and of the patron saint of infertile and pregnant women. But the picture was never delivered to Louis XII since an observer noted its presence in Leonardo’s workshop in 1517 – the artist was then lodged by François I at Cloux, near Amboise. The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne’s reported presence in the Palais Cardinal (the present-day Palais Royal) in 1651 has fuelled the hypothesis that the picture entered the royal collection via Richelieu’s ministrations. But in all likelihood it was François I who acquired it from Leonardo’s assistant, Salai, for a considerable sum recorded in archives. However, prior to Le Brun’s 1683 inventory, no record of such a picture at the Château de Fontainebleau confirms this.

	The symbiosis of form and meaning

	Several preparatory works – the cartoon in the National Gallery in London and several drawings including the one in the Louvre (RF 460) – retrace the work’s gradual development. Leonardo replaced the young Saint John the Baptist in the first sketch by a symbol, the Lamb of God, and slid the Infant Jesus off his mother’s knees towards the ground. He gave more importance to Saint Anne, who becomes the axis of a triangular composition. The figures’ natural gestures interlock with one another: Anne’s right arm blends with Mary’s, whose head conceals her mother’s shoulder, and Mary’s left arm is prolonged by Christ’s. This interplay conveys meaning: the idea of lineage and the Incarnation of Christ, whose destiny, the Passion, is foreshadowed by the Lamb at the precipice’s edge. Leonardo’s originality here lies in his iconography (the addition of the Lamb) and his geometric yet dynamic composition.

	A fascinating and typically “Leonardesque” composition

	As he did in The Virgin of the Rocks, Leonardo set a religious scene in a fantastic landscape and placed an abyss between viewer and figures. The mountainous distance is conveyed by atmospheric perspective with bluish and crystalline highlights and reflects his interest in geology and meteorological phenomena.
	The sfumato, Leonardo’s trademark painterly effect, unifies the composition by enveloping the figures and landscape in a diffuse, evanescent and poetic haze. This imbues the highly expressive faces with great gentleness. The work exudes an aura of strangeness which, combined with the subtle expressions and the picture’s unfinished state has given rise to a number of psychoanalytical interpretations since Freud.
	The picture decisively influenced subsequent generations of artists, both classically-inspired painters such as Raphael and Solario, and Mannerists such as Andrea del Sarto (Charity, INV 712).

Saint Bernard
Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) was a monk who reformed the order of Cistercian monks in the 12th century. He was canonized in 1170, and became patron saint of his place of birth, Burgundy. He is notable for founding the abbey of Clairvaux, a place of authority at the service of the pope and an important development in the Marian cult of the virgin birth, which he fervently promulgated in his writings. It was under his influence that the Cistercians placed all of their churches under the name of Notre Dame. The iconography of the Louvre painting precisely recalls this aspect of the saint's personality. He is shown from the waist up praying before the Virgin and Child who, seated on a cushion, plays with beads. The Virgin holds her hand over an exposed breast, a probable reference to the miracle of lactation. During the Virgin's appearance to the saint, the latter's lips were wetted with a few drops of the milk that nourished Jesus.
The question of style
The painting contains a wealth of references, demonstrating the depth of Joos van Cleve's erudition. The subject was a favorite among artists from Cologne and elsewhere in northern Germany in the late 15th century, and the painter may have been inspired by their paintings. The figure of the Infant and the treatment of the landscape also recall the art of Memling, who at the time exerted an influence that extended well beyond his native town of Bruges.
The landscape
The scene opens out onto a landscape, seen through a window. In the distance stands a medieval church. The landscape adds depth to the picture and creates a vanishing point. A similar composition is found in numerous Flemish paintings, such as the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin by van Eyck. The landscape genre became popular in the 15th century in northern countries, and spread to the rest of Europe with the work of painters like Patinir.

This ovoid-shaped lamp, decorated with a frog framed by a vine scroll, was made in Egypt during the Roman era. Like vine fronds, frogs symbolized rebirth and resurrection, hence their use on Christian lamps.
Illumination in Antiquity
Lamps were produced using two plaster moulds. The oval body has two holes, their rims reinforced with a strip of molding. The hole for the wick, emphasized by a double molding, is at the narrow end of the lamp, corresponding to the nozzle; the other hole, into which the oil was poured, is in the center of the reservoir. The wicks were made from plant fibers, such as papyrus, reed or rush, or strips of linen fabric. Sesame or castor oils were the most commonly used, or in any case the least expensive.The frog is depicted in low relief on the reservoir, its head looking toward the nozzle, while the the body has a granulated surface and the legs are drawn in schematic fashion. It is surrounded by a scroll of gracefully drawn vine tendrils.
A design full of meaning
The ovoid shape may symbolize a creation myth that developed at Hermopolis: from the broken shell of the mysterious primordial egg burst forth the new-born sun, prelude to the creation. The sun embodies light, which here takes material form in the illuminated wick, which annihilates the evil forces of darkness. With its ability to purify and to ward off evil, illumination played an essential part in the divine, funerary, and domestic cults of the Greek and Egyptian religions.The frog, a symbol of rebirth, appeared in amulet form as early as the Predynastic Period. During the Dynastic Period it was identified with Heket, goddess of birth and fertility: the hieroglyph ""frog"" formed part of this goddess's name. Associated with the god Khnum, Heket was worshipped in the city of Antinoe, close to Hermopolis.  In funerary iconography, the vine branch or foliated scroll was an image of rebirth. For this reason, frogs and vine fronds appeared on Christian lamps with the ""ankh"" sign (signifying ""life""), and sometimes the inscription ""ego eimi anastasis formula,"" ""I am the resurrection.""
A functional object charged with meaning
Although this lamp was produced in series and at a late date, it nevertheless retained a strong symbolic significance, rooted as it was in the most profoundly held of Egyptian beliefs, later adopted by the new Christian religion in order to benefit from its talismanic power.

This bronze chandelier, intended to hang in a church, consists of a cylinder bearing a Greek inscription, ""Maria, daughter of Levi,"" surmounted by removable branches in the form of dolphins holding drip glasses, or small containers for oil. Suspended from three long chains, it would have shed a bright circle of light inside the building, far outshining in intensity the more commonplace terracotta lamps with a single spout.
The chandelier
This chandelier is one of a series of chandeliers with hinged branches and a number of light sources that were designed to be suspended. The main section is formed by a broad cylinder, with a central band of open-work Greek letters encircling the cylinder and spelling out ""Maria, daughter of Levi."" The beginning and end of the inscription are separated by sheaf design. A base reinforces the bottom of the cylinder, so that the chandelier could be placed on a flat surface. The three long brass chains by which the object was suspended are positioned around three removable groups of four dolphin silhouettes. Each of the twelve dolphins holds a hinge in its mouth; these hinges consist of two rings attached to the main cylinder. The upturned tails of the dolphins hold rings that support the small oil containers or drip glasses (these are modern additions). The chandelier thus provides twelve sources of light (polylychnion). With its hinged branches and base, this was a practical lamp that could be moved around the church and transported with ease. Like other liturgical objects, it was stored in a cupboard. Examples of chandeliers with cylindrical bodies and hinged branches are also found in Islamic and Armenian cultures.
The dolphin
The dolphin theme was very common in Christian Egypt, particularly on chandeliers and lamps. The Apostles were likened to dolphins because they saved lost souls, just as dolphins save the victims of shipwrecks. The number of dolphins here (twelve) is thus not coincidental and may carry a symbolic meaning. The purely decorative function of these creatures is also important. Here, the craftsman has displayed great ingenuity in using the shape of the animal's body to suit his design.
The function of the chandelier
The chandelier's primary function was naturally to provide illumination. But its materials and dimensions, the number of its drip glasses and its inscription all indicate that it was probably commissioned by a wealthy worshipper and donor, who thus linked her name with a craft or a wish. We do not know where in Egypt this piece was discovered, so any speculation must be undertaken with caution.

If around 1850 Corot used colored paper and charcoal rather than pencil in his drawings, this was because they were the most appropriate means to evoke the imaginative universe splendidly evoked here by this Hymn to the Sun. This reflection on the place of man, immobile at the heart of majestic nature, is bathed in a crepuscular light that gives the composition a mysterious, visionary air.
Day and Night
Together with a number of other artists, such as Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, and Eugène Fromentin, Corot contributed to the decoration of the new Paris mansion of Prince Demidoff. Commissioned by the architect Alfred Feydeau to paint two large panels on the subject of Day and Night, Corot produced these at his friend Philippe Comairas's Fontainebleau studio in July 1865. This drawing and its companion piece, The Sleep of Diana or Night, also in the Louvre (RF 23334), are sketches for those two works, which were executed, according to Corot's biographer Étienne Moreau-Nélaton, during a stay in Arras with his friend Dutilleux.
Corot as decorative painter
In the course of his career, Corot executed other decorative works that no longer survive. He painted several scenes for the summer house in his parents' garden at Ville d'Avray (1847), decorated the dining room at Léon Fleury's house at Magny-les-Hameaux (1855-60), and the Château de Gruyères in Switzerland (1854-58). He also provided several sketches to be used by his pupil Oudinot and the younger Daubigny in the decoration of the latter's father's house at Auvers-sur-Oise.
A change of style
This drawing is highly representative of Corot's second period draftsmanship. His earliest works, in the 1830s, drawn in lead pencil or with a sharpened quill, testify to an extremely analytic vision. The style of the later drawings is, however, very different. From 1850 onward, although remaining firmly attached to reality, Corot developed an increasingly lyrical conception of nature, with effects of light and shade playing a primary role in his work. The incisive pencil was put aside, giving way to charcoal that might or might not be highlighted with white chalk, whose melting accents reinforce the poetic, sometimes melancholic atmosphere of the landscapes. It during this period that Corot started using dyed paper, in buff, brown, or gray, colors suitable for the rendering of deep, velvety shadows.

The painting is of the Mirror of Venus, as Lake Nemi near Rome was known in antiquity. The subject was extremely popular; the artist and such contemporaries as Francis Towne and Francis Pars painted no fewer than ten versions. Wright made this work in about 1790, nearly fifteen years after his tour of Italy. It is a marvellous evocation of the light and warmth of the Mediterranean setting.
Lake Nemi, the mirror of Venus
The waters of the lake reflect the sloping hills around its shores. A few birds are flying over the lake, while a shepherd on a mule is watching over his flock. The site is spectacular. The history and beauty of the lake have always been a source of fascination for artists and travelers. The impression of timeless serenity is heightened by the almost perfectly monochrome swathes of orange-brown that give the painting as a whole a rocky, earthy feel. The delicacy and intelligence of the composition gradually become more apparent, combining the impression of heat and torpor in what is a typically Italian landscape. The scene seems immobilized by the heat and the blinding light. It captures the viewer's gaze and holds it fast, as if to focus all his attention on this mythical site. 
Italy: the art of painting light
In the eighteenth century, a tour of Italy was an absolute must for all aspiring artists. The light, the influence and reputation of the artists of the Renaissance, and the esteem in which painting was held in Italy all made the country a haven for artists. In 1773 Wright set out for Italy. He made many sketches and tried to capture the special quality of the Mediterranean light in his paintings. He paid particular attention to details that conveyed the unique atmosphere. On his return to England in 1775, he used his sketches as a means of keeping his memories of Italy fresh. The attentive observation of details combined with the play of light creates some unusual effects recalling the philosophy of the sublime. The animals and the figure of the peasant highlight the work's skilful blend of imagination and reality.
A multifaceted artist
Wright was born into a wealthy family and studied in the studio of Thomas Hudson in the 1750s. He began painting portraits in about 1760, later showing both history paintings and portraits at the Society of Artists in London. In 1768 he presented his famous work The Experiment with the Air Pump, now in the Tate Britain in London. This work is one of the great masterpieces of British painting, combining ""naiveté and depth,"" as Flaubert wrote, reflecting the peculiarly eighteenth-century fascination for science and description of the emotions. Wright's oeuvre is immensely varied: there are very few genres at which he did not try his hand at some point in his career.

An endearing portrait (dated to c. 1654) of the painter's companion, in the neo-Venetian style cultivated by Rembrandt in his maturity.
The painter's companion
A half-length portrait of a beautiful young woman of about twenty, richly dressed in fur and jewels. This is a loving portrayal by Rembrandt of Hendrickje Stoffels, the second nursemaid of Titus, Rembrandt's son by his wife Saskia (who died in 1642). Hendrickje became Rembrandt's mistress-a relationship that was frowned upon by Calvinist society, and condemned by the Reformed Church of Amsterdam. Yet she remained with Rembrandt and bore him two children, one of whom died very young. Along with Titus, Hendrickje managed an art firm through which Rembrandt sold his works, with shaky financial results, until she died in 1663, six years before the master himself.
A portrait full of tenderness
Rembrandt painted several portraits of Hendrickje, which are now in the Staatliche Museen (Berlin-Dahlem) and the National Gallery in London. The comely young woman was also his model for historical paintings such as the sublime Bathsheba Reading King David's Letter (in the Louvre). In this work, Rembrandt portrays her as loving companion rather than naked, alluring, biblical heroine. The pose is demure, the dark gentle eyes both proud and humble. The trusting expression no doubt reflects Rembrandt's love, but also echoes one of his self-portraits (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel), probably the pendant to this one.
Velvet chiaroscuro
This work has unfortunately suffered somewhat from the ravages of time, making the adorable little velvet cap rather difficult to distinguish. The rough strokes so characteristic of Rembrandt and the relief (usually indicated by layering) are badly worn. But we can still admire the subtle effects of lighting and the delicate, almost transparent shimmer of the fabric covering Hendrickje's shoulders. Light and shade blend into a velvet chiaroscuro, softening the outlines. The golden harmony of color (so close to that of the Venetians, especially of Titian) is characteristic of Rembrandt's mature works. It seems to enhance the gentleness of this model, painted with such tenderness.

This biblical subject is drawn from Samuel I (28:6-14): worried about the outcome of the battle he is preparing to wage against the Philistines, Saul, King of Israel, consults a sorceress who summons Samuel's spirit. Terrified, Saul learns from this ghost that God has abandoned him and that David will be his successor.
Magic in the Bible
The biblical theme is drawn from Samuel I (28:6-14). Worried about his destiny, Saul consults the sorceress of Endor. Illuminated by the fire she summons, the hideous witch calls upon the spirit of Samuel.Samuel appears, his spectral features half-concealed in a sinister sheet resembling a shroud. This motionless phantom, torn from his tomb by necromantic incantations, imparts a gloomy and macabre atmosphere to the scene. He announces that God has chosen David to be king. Prostrate before this vision, Saul is terror-stricken; his guards recoil in horror. Behind them swarm fantastic forms: bony horse heads, bat-winged skeletons, and owls with glowing eyes.
Romantic before romanticism
The contours are strongly traced. The somber tones, heightened with sharp touches of light on the clothing, are suffused with mystery. The lighting contributes to the painting's strange and fantastic atmosphere. In contrast to the frenetic flight that surrounds the Witch, the white apparition borders on pathetic. All the actors in this sabbat are kept in a zone of dark and confusion, where foreboding wins over visibility. Saul and his companions are relegated to the bottom third of the composition.This work was extolled by writers and poets of the 19th century. Théophile Gautier, an enthusiast of visionary romanticism, admired Rosa's theatrical and fantastic character. 
A work of its times
Fascinated by the unknown and the mysteries of the mind, the painter often found his sorcery subjects in the erudite milieux that he frequented in Naples. The development of magic was directly linked to that of modern science and experimentation that exalted inventive genius; Rosa succeeded in grasping the beauty in visions of horror. Very much admired by his peers, the painting was shown in the San Giovanni Decollato church in Rome at an exhibition of older paintings where Rosa was the only living artist represented. Painter as well as musician and poet, the artist composed a satirical ode entitled The Witch (c. 1645). He arrived in Rome in 1649, the period when this painting was created, and quickly became famous; Rosa remained in the Eternal City until his death in 1673.

Friedrich and German Romanticism
The painting shows a scene frequently encountered in the work of this painter, and is typical of German Romantic landscape painting. The composition is marked by simple forms and a strong coherence due to the diffuse light. The different vertical and horizontal shapes balance each other and create an atmosphere of serenity and meditation. The range of colors is limited, but treated with great subtlety.
A landscape with a religious message
The landscape communicates an authentic religious message to which each element of the composition contributes. The different naturalistic motifs painted by Friedrich are the symbols of a divine revelation. Man, facing nature, thus finds himself confronted with his condition and his destiny.
Nature, a reflection of the human condition
The foreground, which is darker than the background, features the earthly world. The fishing lines and the posts provide evidence of human toil. An almost supernatural light from above contrasts with this somber zone, and gives it an other-worldly feeling. The human condition is  represented by the fragile outlines of the fishing boats returning to port, racked by the wind and lost in the immensity of the horizon. Death is also present in the image of the stranded boat. Like an interloping ghost, it gives to the work its true depth in recalling dolefully an always imminent death. Finally, the moon whose light dominates the composition symbolizes Christ the savior of humanity, victorious over death.

As a pendant to The Adoration of the Shepherds, “by a bizarre contrast” Fragonard painted a picture “free and full of passion” (Lenoir, 1816), showing profane as opposed to sacred love. Its porcelain-like light effects illustrate the evolution of his work after he returned from his second trip to Italy in 1774.
The Bolt and its pendant, The Adoration of the Shepherds
The composition of The Bolt appeared for the first time in a drawing by Fragonard auctioned in 1777 and popularized by Blot’s 1784 engraving. The picture acquired by the Louvre in 1974 was therefore painted between these two dates. It was commissioned by the Marquis de Véri, as a pendant to The Adoration of the Shepherds (RF 1988-11), but the two works separated at the auction after his death in 1785, and were not reunited until The Adoration of the Shepherds was donated to the Louvre in 1988. The only thing the pictures have in common is their format and color range, yet their strange contrast was not merely the result of some painterly whim.
A hidden meaning?
At first sight, The Bolt is just another of the many amorous scenes Fragonard painted. A woman is half-heartedly fending off her lover’s advances. But looking closer, one notices intriguing details. Why is the man bolting the door if the room is already in a disarray indicating what is to come? In this light, certain objects unveil their erotic symbolism: the knocked-over chair (legs in the air), the vase and roses (allusions to the female genitals), the bolt (male genitals), and especially the bed, taking up most of the left of the composition. Its anthropomorphic forms make it the scene’s principal actor, and its manifest disorder embodies the protagonists’ sexual urges.
Beyond this, opinions differ. D. Arasse considers The Bolt and The Adoration to be complementary illustrations of the power of love and desire in their human, spiritual and physical dimensions. For J. Thuillier, on the other hand, the two pictures contrast profane and sacred love, sin and redemption. The Bolt symbolizes Eve’s temptation (in which case the apple on the table is charged with meaning) which, in Christian tradition is sometimes associated with the Nativity.
A sign of an artistic evolution
A simple genre scene in the saucy spirit of the Louis XVI period, or a moralist history painting? The Bolt deliberately upsets the hierarchy of genres. Whatever meaning we ascribe it, the picture breaks with Fragonard’s previous work. He painted it after 1774 and the second stay in Italy which revitalized his inspiration. Having been refused a prestigious commission by Countess du Barry, Fragonard wanted to show his ability to adapt to evolutions in taste and the emergence of the Neoclassical style of Vien (see Inv 8431) and Pierre. In this purified composition, he reinterprets Dutch art, particularly that of Rembrandt. His smoother, more faience-like treatment, reduced palette and forms softened by the use of sfumato yet powerfully modeled in chiaroscuro, imbue his late works with a new poetry and gravity.

This work confirms Delacroix's desire to follow in the footsteps of the masters while allowing himself a certain freedom. At first sight, the combination of color and ornament and the energy emanating from the painting may overshadow the methodical and painstaking preparation that went into its construction. This magnificent work—so gigantic that Victor Hugo considered it ""beyond small minds""—marked a decisive turning point in Delacroix's career and in his era.
My massacre number two
Delacroix, inspired by Byron's tragedy Sardanapalus, drew on a range of influences to produce this painting: ancient sources such as Diodorus of Sicily, contemporaries including Victor Hugo and Rossini, and less obvious influences such as Etruscan sculpture, Persian miniatures, and Indian customs. Byron merely hinted at the outcome of his play, which he dedicated to Goethe: besieged by his enemies in his palace, Sardanapalus committed suicide. Delacroix, however, imagined that the king also burned his worldly possessions and everything that had given him pleasure: women, pages, horses, dogs, and treasures. The painter gave expression to his idea through a personal style resulting from his prodigious pictorial culture, a blend of French, Flemish, Dutch, Italian, English, Oriental, classical, and modern influences. 
Above a burning pyre, King Sardanapalus, draped in white, reclines on a sumptuous jewel-inlaid bed adorned with gilded elephant heads and covered with scarlet fabric, as his cruel sentence is carried out. This complex, superhuman figure, both judge and executioner, actor and spectator, lies semi-recumbent on the bed, one hand supporting his head. With his beard and turban he resembles a Mughal or Qajar sultan, while his pose evokes a classical statue, a figure by Michelangelo, Delacroix’s Michelangelo in his Studio, Rembrandt’s Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem, or Heraclitus in Raphael’s School of Athens. 
The force of the composition matches the violence of the event; the subject matter, architectural setting, dramatic technique and tension, theatrical effects of light, and gestures of fear evoke the work of English painters such as Turner, William Etty, and John Martin. The painting is surprising too for the daring of its foreshortened perspective, for the effects of light, and for the cool, clear colors that propel the heart of the scene toward the viewer. The painting features a diagonal—emphasized by the flames of the pyre and the sensually writhing bodies—that crosses from bottom right to top left, its colors gradually changing from a deep red to a pearly pink against which the creamy flesh of the naked bodies and the raw white of the king's drapery are accentuated.
As the city burns in the distance, the palace seems swept away on a raging wave that destroys all notion of hierarchy, gender, species, and rank. All logic is lost as masters, soldiers, slaves, men, women, animals, bodies, objects, attitudes, movements, materials, life, and death are tangled together in piteous disarray. Brutally cast into the furnace because of the king's arrogant refusal to surrender, the figures are reminiscent of certain biblical characters, the groups in Charles le Brun’s series of paintings from the life of Alexander, or the massacre of the princes in Jacques-Louis David's Funeral of Patroclus.
One of the finest feathers in my cap
The women resemble the female figures painted by Correggio or Rubens; contrasting with the king's perfect stillness, they are convulsed with horror, and take their own lives before having their throats slit by officers and slaves. The king's favorite, Myrrha, lies at his feet, her back naked, her head and arms outstretched on the bed; a guard facing her draws his sword to kill a bare-shouldered female slave. Against a harmony of rich, muted, and refined tones at the bottom right of the funeral pyre, echoing the royal couple, a guard kills a slave whose voluptuous body and pearly golden skin are reminiscent of Rubens's sea nymphs (in the Galerie Médicis in the Louvre). The bust of a naked woman lying in front of this couple evokes Delacroix’s Mulatto Woman; to their right, a man submits to his fate, head in hands, while another beseeches the king, one arm outstretched. In the half-light at the top right of the painting, Aischeh (whom the painter mentions in the Salon booklet) has hung herself. The central figures are set off by a more compact group to the left of the pyre. At the top, level with the king, his cup-bearer Baleah (also named in the booklet) presents him with a ewer, basin, and towel. A woman just below veils her face before a man who stabs himself in the chest. The brightness of the central scene is balanced by the bottom left corner, with the dark but translucent forearm of the black slave and the dapple gray of the horse he pulls toward the pyre. This small group, like the overall composition, recalls the vigor of painters such as Théodore Géricault, Antoine-Jean Gros, Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, and Tintoretto.
Delacroix used well distributed colors, contrasts of light, shadow, and halftones, extremes of red and white, swift brushstrokes, and a subtle play of bold, vibrant impasto juxtaposed with clear bright glaze to glorify the smoothness of flesh, the shimmer of fabrics, and the gleam of the jewels and treasures in the foreground of his painting. This technique, coupled with rich and intricate ornamentation, creates a strong sense of life, movement, and aesthetic unity. 
The many preparatory sketches made by the painter over a six-month period, in which he analyzed the movements and positions of the bodies, the accessories, the groups, the tension and dynamics of the scene, and the intensity of expressions, reflect his desire to dominate the overall composition yet preserve its spontaneity.
My Waterloo
After the travels of Champollion and Dominique Vivant Denon, ancient oriental subjects were in vogue among both Neoclassical and contemporary painters, as were Egypt, Palmyra, Persia, and biblical themes. Delacroix knew that the only way of making his mark on his era was to interpret such subjects in a highly personal manner that would distinguish him from the great masters of the past. But devotees of classicism and institutional authorities judged his turbulent composition, with its cascade of figures, violent emotions, and muscular bodies, to be subversive, like the work of English painters who were considered avant-gardist. At the time, therefore, the question of form took priority over the artist's reflection on civilization and destiny, and over the emotion of his work and its intellectual, sensual, poetic, visual, and spiritual expression.

Chactas the Indian and Father Aubry are burying Atala, heroine of Chateaubriand's novel, published in 1801. Everything about this funerary elogy - the Christian subject, the exotic setting, intense emotions - must have appealed to those who, on the fringes of David's rigor, remained attached to the sacred, to nature and sentiment. 
A young woman torn between love and religion
In the sunset, in a cave, the old hermit, Father Aubry, is supporting the corpse of the half-caste Atala. Chactas the Indian, stricken with grief, clings passionately to the young woman's knees. Atala, torn between her love for Chactas and the vow she took to remain a virgin and a Christian, committed suicide. With a crucifix clutched in her hand and the drapery of her dress clinging to her bust, she is both pure and sensual. After their all-night vigil, the two men will bury her in the cave. A verse from the Book of Job is carved on the cave wall: ""When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked with the hand, it withereth before all herbs."" Girodet drew his subject from Chateaubriand's Atala, or the Loves of Two Savages in the Wilderness (1801), set in America in the 17th century. This novel by the first French romantic novelist was published in his hugely popular The Genius of Christianity. The book celebrated Catholicism at the time when Bonaparte signed the Concordat with the Church. The exoticism, the defense of the innocence of primitive peoples and the religious sentiment that characterized the novel are all transposed into the picture. Girodet has not merely illustrated a single scene from Chateaubriand's novel, he has synthesized several passages. He has also forsaken the antique subjects dear to his master, David, for new subject matter: for Girodet, unlike David, painting no longer has a moral or political function. 
An innovative painter
Girodet showed this painting at the 1808 Salon, where it was widely acclaimed. It was bought by the anti-Empire journalist Louis-François Bertin, who later posed for Ingres' famous portrait (Musée du Louvre). Chateaubriand admired the painting, as did another romantic writer, Charles Baudelaire. Girodet, who had become famous at the 1793 Salon for his extremely strange picture, The Sleep of Endymion (Musée du Louvre), was an innovative painter, both in subject matter and style.  
Neoclassicism and romanticism
Girodet used a traditional composition of Christian iconography, The Entombment, for this canvas. Yet, in the manner of his master, David, his figures are aligned in a frieze-like manner and his drawing is precise. The dead Atala is somewhat unrealistically portrayed as an ideal beauty, and Girodet reuses the chiaroscuro effect of The Sleep of Endymion: the light caresses Chactas' back and Atala's bust and lips. The picture, foreshadowing romanticism, is steeped in sensuality, emotion and religiosity, and the scene's exotic setting and vegetation are a far cry from David's austere decors.

In the second series of Sacraments that Poussin painted in Rome between 1644 and 1648 and that he sent to his friend Chantelou in Paris, the painting of the sacrament of the Eucharist was painted in autumn 1647. This was a preliminary drawing, and the final composition (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, loaned by the Duke of Sutherland) differs in only a few features.
From Last Supper to Eucharist
Poussin chose to illustrate the Seven Sacraments by scenes of the life of Christ, evoking the Eucharist by the founding episode of the Last Supper before the Passion. Christ, in the center, is surrounded by the recumbent apostles on classical-style couches, in an arrangement that Poussin had seen in the engravings of Antonio Bosio (d. 1629; Roma Sotterranea, 1632) reproducing paintings of the Roman catacombs. It is a triclinium in which the guests can be arranged on three sides or in a half-moon.
Faithful to the Gospel
Poussin respected the canonical basis of the scene. Christ blesses the bread that he is to give to the eleven faithful apostles around him and whose looks converge on his face, illuminated by a halo. Judas, the twelfth apostle, is leaving by the left. Jesus announces to his disciples that one of them will betray him.
Light and shade
Few of Poussin's drawings succeed as well as this one in the treatment of light and shade and in the dramatization of lighting. As in the work of Rembrandt, light plays a moral role, illuminating the face of Jesus and those of the apostles, curiously represented by ovals with wavy contours (we know that Poussin occasionally suffered from a trembling hand from the early 1640s onwards). He hesitated in certain details of the composition, and especially in the position of the apostle in the right foreground, first drawing him with a leg stretched out behind and then retouching the pose. The drawing bears on the left the initials of Chantelou, who commissioned the painting. This drawing thus also belonged to him.

The excellent title, Le Coup de soleil (The Ray of Sunlight), dates back to the early nineteenth century. The painting, from the 1660s, is one of the artist's masterpieces. For him, it is a rare example of panoramic grandeur reminiscent of Rembrandt. The figures of bathers have sometimes (ingeniously) been attributed to Wouwerman.
An ideal landscape
This imaginary landscape by Jacob Van Ruisdael is a vast panorama based on subtle diagonals (clouds, rivers, hills) and composed around a number ol elements taken from the real world: windmills, the ruins of a small bridge and those of Brederode Castle (near Haarlem), and the hills of Gelderland or the Rhineland. A huge sky takes up two thirds of the painting; the tiny figures of bathers and of a horseman dressed in red enliven the broad landscape. This work reflects the trend for idealized landscapes in the European painting of the period.
A masterly ray of sunlight
Once simply referred to as 'The effect of the sun after the rain', this painting was not given the name Le Coup de soleil (The Ray of Sunlight) until the nineteenth century. And the painting's space is, indeed, brilliantly orchestrated by the sunlight, with alternating areas of light and shadow. The wheat fields are strongly lit by its rays; their bright yellow contrasts with the overall tonal harmony of gray-blue and green. The light also sculpts the fleecy banks of clouds on their slow and silent progress, conferring a peaceful, grandiose dynamism to the work. The atmosphere is heavy with humidity although the storm has passed, and there are still signs of rain in the distance.
Reference to Rembrandt
This composition, with its subtle diagonals and ruins among the hills, closely resembles the work of Rembrandt, notably his Landscape with a Castle (in the Louvre). The only splashes of color come from the small figures, which seem to have been painted by someone other than Ruisdael. A tradition dating back to the eighteenth century attributes them (quite plausibly) to Philips Wouwerman (who died in 1668); this would mean that The Ray of Sunlight dates from the 1660s. It is difficult to date this painting more precisely, since it resembles none of the artist's other works. It is one of Ruisdael's greatest paintings - a sublime and moving masterpiece, whose musicality inspires a feeling of dreamy melancholy.

Endymion the shepherd, a man of ideal beauty, is being visited at night by the goddess Diana in the form of a moonbeam. Her passage through the foliage is facilitated by Zephyr. In this early work, painted in Rome in 1791, Girodet, a pupil of David, demarcated himself from his master and foreshadowed romanticism. The idealized nude is antique in inspiration but the moonlight and the mysterious, dreamlike atmosphere are hallmarks of an emerging sensibility.
Sleeping beauty
The shepherd Endymion, the most beautful mortal according to mythology, is sleeping naked beneath a plane tree. Juno, whom he had offended, put him to sleep for thirty years, during which he retained his youthfulness. The chaste Diana has succumbed to his perfect beauty and visits him nightly. The goddess, who is associated with the moon, manifests herself here in the form of a moonbeam, which caresses Endymion's face and torso. Zephyr facilitates the Moon's passage by pulling back the branches of a laurel tree. 
An academy figure appreciated by Chateaubriand, Balzac and Baudelaire
Girodet painted this early work in 1791, during his stay at the French Academy in Rome. Every year, residents at the Academy had to send one academy figure (a study of a nude model) to the members of the Académie Royale de Peinture in Paris. Endymion is an academy figure which Girodet used as the character of a history painting. He exhibited the picture at the 1793 Salon, where it received a mixed reception. Later, the work would have the rare honor of being admired by the great romantic writers Chateaubriand, Balzac and Baudelaire. Chateaubriand's novel Atala would serve as the inpsiration for Girodet's 1808 painting, The Entombment of Atala (Musée du Louvre).
The urge to ""do something new""
Girodet, as he himself wrote, wanted to ""do something new"" in this work. A pupil of David, he chose a mythological love scene more likely to have  fascinated a baroque or rococo painter then his master. There is nothing heroic or moral about this painting. Endymion is a character from a Greek myth later transformed into a Roman fable told by Lucian in his Dialogues of the Gods. Girodet based his picture not on the Greek myth, in which the shepherd is loved by Selene, but on the Roman fable. Endymion's body is suprisingly elongated, almost mannerist, and his pose is reminiscent of Correggio's mythological figures or certain baroque martyrs. He exudes a blend of sensuality and coldness. The picture's light is also very different to paintings by David and his pupils. The deep woodland shadows are traversed by a curiously blue-tinted shaft of light. The light on Endymion's body shows Girodet's taste for the bizarre: his moonlit torso is bathed in a vaporous effect evoking Leonardo da Vinci and Correggio, artists little appreciated at the time, except by Prud'hon. It is precisely this strangeness which heralds the emerging romantic sensibility.

Leonardo’s emblematic and complexly symbolic The Virgin of the Rocks celebrates the mystery of Incarnation in portrayals of the Virgin Mary, Christ and Saint John the Baptist. For the first time, these holy figures, bathed in a gentle light, are set in rocky landscape. The many contemporary copies of the picture attest to the immense popularity of this new vision of the theme.
A complex history
The Louvre version of the picture was to have been the central part of a polyptych which the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception commissioned Leonardo and the de Predis brothers to paint for a chapel in the church of San Francesco Grande in Milan in 1483. The other version, now in the National Gallery in London and known to have formerly been in this chapel, and several archive documents indicate that the Louvre painting was never installed there. Its presence in the French royal collection is attested from1627, but several clues suggest it may have been acquired much earlier.
The most convincing hypothesis is that the picture, painted between 1483 and 1486, did not meet with Leonardo’s clients’ full satisfaction, which enabled Louis XII to acquire it around 1500−1503. The second, replacement picture, now in London, may have been painted by Ambrogio de Predis under Leonardo’s supervision between 1495 and 1508.
Ambiguous iconography
Comparison of the two versions of The Virgin of the Rocks clearly shows the ambiguous iconography of the first, about which much has been written. The identity of the figures may indeed appear unclear due to the absence of attributes and the pre-eminence of the infant Saint John, placed alongside the Virgin Mary, indicated by the archangel Gabriel’s pointing finger and Jesus’s sign of blessing. The desert in which the meeting between the two immaculately conceived children is traditionally depicted has been replaced by a supernatural rocky grotto, water and plants. The mystery of the Incarnation is celebrated by the role of Mary and the precursor John, who in Florentine tradition was one of Jesus’s childhood playmates and already aware of his future sacrifice for mankind. This prefiguration of Christ’s Passion seems to be echoed by the precipice on the edge of which the Infant Jesus is sitting and the vegetation surrounding him (aconite, palms, iris).
A totally innovative composition
The Virgin of the Rocks is the first picture Leonardo is known to have produced in Milan and has stylistic similarities with works painted towards the end of his stay in Florence such as The Adoration of the Magi (Florence) and Saint Jerome (Rome), whose aesthetic concepts it develops. The rigorously ordered pyramidal composition does not hinder the movement of the figures, and the painstaking orchestration of their gestures (the superimposition of hands and interplay of looks) takes on a new intensity in the diffuse light which softens outlines without weakening the modeling of the figures. 
The figures’ natural poses and the omnipresence of the predominantly mineral landscape are highly innovative compared to the affected architecture and hieratic poses of the altarpieces of the period. Yet it was not until 1501, when the cartoon of Saint Anne was first shown in Florence (see INV 776) that these principles were put into practice by other artists.

This drawing in black chalk and brown wash, with white highlights, shows Phaedra and Hippolytus. It is one of a few preparatory drawings for the canvas that Guérin exhibited at the Salon in 1802. Presented to the public only a few days before the Salon was due to close, the painting was so popular that the exhibition was extended.
Juxtaposed characters
In the center of the drawing is a weeping woman, with a child in her arms, pointing to a wall where we can make out the shadow of an embracing couple. The same motif appears in the left corner of the sheet, without the shadow, for which Guérin would have to have used wash, a pictorial medium that renders light and contrasts. On the right is Hippolytus, his arm outstretched in a gesture of denial, shown from the side, whereas he is shown from the front in the painting.The scene remains an enigma. There is only one version known apart from the one in the Louvre: a painting in the Musée d'Angers, which, for lack of a better title, is called Jealousy. The drawing no doubt provides the key to the problem, for two complementary reasons. The first is external: the presence of the motif on the left, linked to the figure of Hippolytus on the right. The second is internal: an analysis of the gestures that connect the two figures by reverse symmetry.
A mysterious scene
The woman's outstretched arm echoes that of Hippolytus. The shadow is an allegory by default, inspired by a theme in vogue in painting at the time: the daughter of Dibutades sketching her lover's profile on the wall, an act regarded as the origin of the art of painting. This would suggest that it has some connection with Phaedra, although this is paradoxical, for the unhappy mother seems very maternal in her distress and would make us think of Andromache clutching Astyanax. But if she is Andromache, what about the shadow on the wall? Is it to be seen as a cruel reminder of the happy days when her legitimate husband, Hector, was still alive, or the hated image of Pyrrhus, to whom she was given after Hector's death? Phaedra, who seemed a less likely heroine at first, is in fact a more logical choice. The decisive argument is to be found in Racine. In a famous monologue, Phaedra, learning of Hippolytus' love for Aricia, gives a heart-rending account of their youthful happiness, which is an insult to her solitude:""Heaven approves the innocence of their sighs;They follow their amorous inclinations without remorseFor them, every day dawns clear and serene.""
A theatrical form of Classicism
Guérin's drawing conforms to the spirit of early 19th-century classicism, adding a tinge of dissolution in its theatrical aspect. Painting had become a stage; artists sought to emulate writers like Racine who dealt in tragedy without terror, emotion without grandiloquence, the pathetic without pathos.

This small painting on wood was one of the first works by Fragonard to enter the Louvre, in 1856, well before the more sensational works from the famous La Caze collection that were bequeathed to the museum in 1869. It was a little-known work that long escaped the attention of Fragonard specialists, partly because of its small size, but mostly because it was not put on display in the museum. The major interest of this little painting lies in its original mise-en-scène: through an interplay of gazes, the viewer is both observer and…observed.
A mirror effect
Two young girls look toward the viewer through a gap in the gray drapes that they are holding apart. The face on the right is only half visible; the bolder girl on the left is in clearer view. She wears a mischievous smile, and has slipped one arm through the drapes, preparing to throw a handful of rose petals that she has no doubt taken from the little basket on the right. A breast has been inadvertently revealed by the opened drapes. There is a particularly elegant use of color, with a subtle variation of muted pinks and dull reds embellished by the pearl gray and shimmering white of the drapes. The interplay of gazes in this little scene creates such a remarkable mirror effect that we wonder who has surprised whom…
A suggestive scene
The atmosphere in this scene recalls the painter's fondness for themes of this kind, that he treated in distinctive and spirited style. The symmetrical twist of the drapes discreetly echoes the tangled folds in the painting entitled The Bolt, in which they represent the whirlwind of desire. The ambiguous and somewhat erotic nature of the scene is heightened by the breast that seems to hold a promise of even greater youthful charms; the nonchalant and graceful hand suggests the kind of unbalanced pose that so often featured in the intimate scenes painted by this artist. The delicate yet emphatic brushwork, together with the pastel colors, expresses delight in the curves of flesh, the caress of petals, the swirl of fabric.
Fragonard and his contemporaries
The reputation for frivolity that is too often and too easily attributed to Fragonard should not eclipse the multiple facets of his talent. His oeuvre included religious painting, historic and mythological themes, allegories, portraits, great landscapes, and intimist scenes like this one. Yet he is the unquestioned representative of the French 18th century—the period that delighted in secret doors, stolen moments, intrigues, and ambiguity, when the theater intertwined with everyday life, backstage and forestage suddenly merging, the viewer finding himself both observer and observed. The highly evocative space confined by the drapes brings to mind the intimacy and elegance of the boudoir with its atmosphere of privacy and seclusion and its suggestion of eroticism...

Discovered in 1698 in Golconda, India, this stone immediately attracted the interest of Thomas Pitt, the English governor of Madras. Cut in England, it was then purchased for the French Crown at the behest of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans in 1717. The Regent surpassed in beauty and weight all the diamonds known in the western world until that time. Even today, its flawless brilliance and perfect cut ensure that it is still considered the finest diamond in the world.

	How the ""Regent"" was acquired and then cut in England

	Following its discovery in India in 1698, the stone was acquired by Thomas Pitt, Governor of Fort St George in Madras, for a very high price. The diamond weighed 426 carats before it was shipped to England in 1702 to be cut. This operation took two years, from 1704 to 1706, and produced several secondary stones, which were sold to Tsar Peter the Great. Performed by a jeweler by the name of Harris, this cut is the culmination of a technique possibly invented in Venice in the early seventeenth century: the brilliant cut. In this process, the angles, formed by the facets, are of a perfect cut, reflecting the light with matchless intensity and brilliance.

	The acquisition of the diamond by Philippe d'Orléans

	Taking advantage of the economic prosperity that developed in France under the influence of John Law, Philippe d'Orléans, regent from 1715 to 1723, persuaded the Regency Council to purchase the diamond on 6 June 1717. At the time, The Regent outshone all known diamonds in the western world, and by 1719 it had already tripled in value. Today, it is still considered the finest diamond in the world; its color is ""of the first water"", that is perfectly white and practically flawless. After the Regency, the gem remained one of the most precious of the Crown's treasures and adorned all the crowned heads of France.

	The ""Regent"" and the royal succession

The Regent was worn for the first time by Louis XV at the reception of a Turkish embassy in 1721. It was then mounted temporarily on the king's crown for his coronation ceremony on 25 October 1722. Shortly after his marriage to Maria Leczinska on 5 September 1725, Louis XV began wearing the diamond on his hat, a habit he continued throughout his reign. For the coronation of Louis XVI, on 11 June 1775, a new crown was made similar to that of Louis XV, featuring The Regent on the front. Like his grandfather, Louis XVI sported the gem on his hat. Stolen in 1792, then found again the following year hidden in some roof timbers, the diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat, before being permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801. The First Consul used it to embellish his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, the work of Nitot. Following changes in the ruling regime, the diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III, and finally on the Grecian diadem of Empress Eugénie.

The painting is of the Mirror of Venus, as Lake Nemi near Rome was known in antiquity. The subject was extremely popular; the artist and such contemporaries as Francis Towne and Francis Pars painted no fewer than ten versions. Wright made this work in about 1790, nearly fifteen years after his tour of Italy. It is a marvellous evocation of the light and warmth of the Mediterranean setting.
Lake Nemi, the mirror of Venus
The waters of the lake reflect the sloping hills around its shores. A few birds are flying over the lake, while a shepherd on a mule is watching over his flock. The site is spectacular. The history and beauty of the lake have always been a source of fascination for artists and travelers. The impression of timeless serenity is heightened by the almost perfectly monochrome swathes of orange-brown that give the painting as a whole a rocky, earthy feel. The delicacy and intelligence of the composition gradually become more apparent, combining the impression of heat and torpor in what is a typically Italian landscape. The scene seems immobilized by the heat and the blinding light. It captures the viewer's gaze and holds it fast, as if to focus all his attention on this mythical site. 
Italy: the art of painting light
In the eighteenth century, a tour of Italy was an absolute must for all aspiring artists. The light, the influence and reputation of the artists of the Renaissance, and the esteem in which painting was held in Italy all made the country a haven for artists. In 1773 Wright set out for Italy. He made many sketches and tried to capture the special quality of the Mediterranean light in his paintings. He paid particular attention to details that conveyed the unique atmosphere. On his return to England in 1775, he used his sketches as a means of keeping his memories of Italy fresh. The attentive observation of details combined with the play of light creates some unusual effects recalling the philosophy of the sublime. The animals and the figure of the peasant highlight the work's skilful blend of imagination and reality.
A multifaceted artist
Wright was born into a wealthy family and studied in the studio of Thomas Hudson in the 1750s. He began painting portraits in about 1760, later showing both history paintings and portraits at the Society of Artists in London. In 1768 he presented his famous work The Experiment with the Air Pump, now in the Tate Britain in London. This work is one of the great masterpieces of British painting, combining ""naiveté and depth,"" as Flaubert wrote, reflecting the peculiarly eighteenth-century fascination for science and description of the emotions. Wright's oeuvre is immensely varied: there are very few genres at which he did not try his hand at some point in his career.

During the classical and Hellenistic periods, Etruscan craftsmen excelled in the production of bronze mirrors decorated with mythological scenes. This example depicts Turan (Aphrodite), identified by an inscription, riding a swan while making the gesture of anakalypsis (unveiling). This subject, which was particularly appropriate for items of toiletry, appeared first in Greece in the fifth century BCE, and was successfully revived in Etruria in the fourth century.
Etruscan engraved mirrors
In the fourth and third century BCE, the Etruscans excelled particularly in their prolific production of engraved mirrors, a luxury item for women's toilet, decorated with a variety of scenes borrowed from Hellenic or local mythology. This mirror, dating from the late fourth century BCE, is an example of the most widespread type. The handle, cast at the same time as the disc, terminates in the head of a hind, a symbol of femininity. The reflective surface of the disc is slightly convex, and the back is decorated with incised motifs.
Turan riding a swan
The subject depicted on this mirror is particularly suitable both for its function and for the circular surface to which the craftsman was restricted. The disc is framed by a garland of laurel leaves. The medallion in the center features the goddess Turan, the Etruscan Aphrodite, identified in inscription (which reads from right to left) near the young woman's face. The goddess rides a swan, one of her customary companions. With wings outspread, the bird holds a branch in its beak. Turan winds her left arm round the swan's neck, while with her right hand she draws aside a panel of her garment, as though unveiling herself (in Greek, the gesture of 'anakalypsis').
An echo of ancient Greek and Italian painted motifs
A number of Etruscan mirrors are decorated with a similar scene, differing only in detail. The motif appeared in Greece in the fifth century BCE, notably on painted terracotta vases.

Regional styles were still prevalent in the early years of the fifth century BCE. This bronze mirror, thought to come from Thebes, is a valuable example of the work of craftsmen on the island of Egina (off the Attic coast). The disc rests on the head of a caryatid reminiscent of the Archaic korai. The hairstyle, facial features and position of the arms, however, anticipate the new aesthetic of the Severe style.
A caryatid mirror
This bronze mirror illustrates a type of object produced in abundance in Greece in the sixth century and first half of the fifth century BCE. The vogue for mirrors on pedestals was subsequently gradually replaced by mirror boxes. Unlike mirrors with handles, mirrors on stands were not intended to be held in the hand but rather placed on a table. This example, purchased in 1888, was claimed to have been discovered in Thebes in Boeotia (central Greece) six years earlier. The foot, in the form of a caryatid, is attached to the disc by a fixing tipped at each end with a flowerbud. The metal was originally polished to high sheen to obtain a reflective surface. The female figure stands on a stool with four legs terminating in horse-hoof feet.     
The aesthetic of Archaic korai with Severe-style innovations
The statuette was made c.490-480 BCE, at the beginning of the period known as the Severe style. It remains reminiscent of Archaic korai, from which it borrows the hieratic, frontal pose, the distribution of weight and the garment embroidered with incised motifs. The young woman is depicted in a standing position, her legs tightly swathed in the fabric of a chiton that is belted at the waist. At the same time a number of details reflect the aesthetic canon of the new Severe style. The heavy, shoulder-length hair has here been replaced by a simpler hairstyle, consisting of two wavy swathes of hair gathered into a bun at the neck and caught up under a pearl-trimmed band crowning the head. The figure's impassive face breaks with the conventions of the sixth century BCE, and her grave expression is far removed from the welcoming smiles of the Archaic figures. The position of the arms suggests a slight movement that helps to define the figure in space. The right hand, partially preserved, probably held a flower or other attribute.
Made in an Egina workshop
The Boeotian origins of this mirror have long been considered questionable. It may have been found at Thebes, but it was almost certainly made at a workshop on Egina, an island off the Attic coast. A number of features associate it with the style of locally produced small objects, and above all with the decorative sculpture of the temple of Athena Aphaia, which dates from the same period. The stylistic treatment of the caryatid is very similar to that of the Athena on the west pediment. Like the statue of the goddess, the bronze figurine wears Ionian dress (the chiton), a feature that distinguishes it from the statuettes clad in the Dorian peplos that were common at the time in Boeotia, Argolide and the Corinth region. The foot of this mirror thus offers valuable proof of the persistence of regional styles in the first half of the fifth century BCE.

The silver treasure discovered in 1895 at Boscoreale in a Roman villa buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 contained only a few toiletry objects. However, like this mirror richly decorated with a mythological scene in relief, these luxury items made in the first century of our era reveal a flourishing period of Roman silverwork. The decoration representing the meeting of Leda and Jupiter, turned into a swan, is a hymn to femininity and sensuality.
The Boscoreale silver treasure
A violent eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Naples region, burying the towns of  Pompeii and Herculaneum in particular. The catastrophe froze the everyday life of the inhabitants, saving for posterity many ordinary or precious objects that were rediscovered in their original context from the eighteenth century on. In 1895, the excavation of a Roman villa at Boscoreale on the slopes of the volcano yielded an exceptionally large silver treasure consisting of 109 tableware, toiletry, and jewelry items buried in a cistern by the owner before the tragedy. This magnificent set of objects came to the Louvre in the same year, thanks to the generosity of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Made between the end of the first century BC and the beginning of the first century of our era, the treasure dates from one of the most brilliant periods of Roman silverwork. Like the two other mirrors found in the villa, this one illustrates the decorative and technical richness of objects designed for women.
A toiletry object
Polished on one side to reflect the face of the user, this silver mirror is mounted on a baluster handle terminating in two heads of birds with long beaks and affixed to the disc by a stylized leaf of a design widespread in Campania. Although it might seem unusual, the presence of women's toiletry objects in a treasure consisting mainly of tableware is hardly surprising. Mirrors were precious objects for the lady of the house and often hidden away in case of danger, in the same way as jewelry or dishes.
The myth of Leda and the Swan
The decoration of these luxury objects generally echoed their function, as is demonstrated by the medallion with the repoussé work decoration in relief on the back of the disc. The subject, taken from mythology, is a paean to feminine seductiveness and is well suited, therefore, for decorating a toiletry object. Extremely widespread in ancient iconography from the fourth century BC on, especially in silverwork,  the scene depicts the meeting between Jupiter and Leda. After falling in love with the young woman, the god changed himself into a swan so that he could approach her and satisfy his passion. Seated on a rock and in an advanced state of undress, Leda is giving water from a patera to the bird whose outspread wings and claw resting on the girl's knees show its impatience.  The tale is handled with delicately sober refinement; sensuality emerges through allusions, without giving way to the sometimes crude eroticism of some illustrations of Jupiter's romances.

The mirror is decorated on the back with a portrait of the young Louis XIII on his marriage to Anne of Austria in 1615. The border depicts birds, flowers, and foliage in enamel on metal foil, with a crown above. The mirror was made at a time when Limoges was increasing its production of small items, sometimes linked, like the present work, to current events.
A mirror with an inner compartment
The mirror opens onto a compartment where a love token or lock of hair can be kept. It also has a ring, allowing it to be hung from a belt on a chain. Small enamels were also used to decorate pendants and watchcases. The subjects depicted might be mythological, religious, or, as here, profane.
The portrait
This portrait of the fifteen-year-old Louis XIII closely matches contemporary engravings of his marriage to the young Anne of Austria in November 1615. Enamels featuring portraits of his bride exist with similar borders. The wedding itself is depicted on an enamel in the British Museum in London, done after an engraving dating from the engagement in 1612, in which the two adolescents look much younger. 
The enameler
The mirror is unsigned. Two enamelers are known to have produced portraits of the royal family in the first third of the seventeenth century. The first, who portrayed Henri IV and Marie de' Medici on salts now at the Musée d'Angers, signed his work IC and must be Jehan Court, called Vigier. The second, who signed his work IL, made the little portrait of Louis XIII at the age of around twenty-five now in the Wallace Collection in London. The style of the border allows this mirror to be attributed to the second of the two, who might be either the Jehan Limosin who signed the Esther and Ahasuerus plate, or the Joseph Limosin who signed a salt now in the Louvre, enamelers with both these forenames being documented for the first half of the seventeenth century.

The mirror was purchased by Louis XIV in 1684 from the dealer Le Brun at the same time as the sconce MR 251. It comprises several pieces of sard and cameos. The stones are set off by a metalwork mount in the style of Pierre Delabarre, a 17th-century goldsmith. This work reflects the interest of 17th-century collectors in hard stone and the richness of Louis XIV's collection of precious and semiprecious stones.
Cameos and sard to frame a mirror
The rectangular rock-crystal mirror is set in a frame decorated with pieces of sard, probably reused stones. The shape of the frame is evocative of a window recess or frame. It comprises a discontinuous arched pediment supported by two small columns, and a base. The two molded elements forming the pediment may have come from ancient vases; the gray agate columns were possibly produced as part of the decoration of a cabinet; and the two small vases at the top corners were probably carved from reused agate eggs. The cameos date from the Renaissance. The agate cameos on the frieze depict the twelve Caesars facing each other two by two; the cameo at the center of the base shows Diana's head in profile; and the cameo in the center of the pediment represents a woman's head, also in profile. At the foot of the columns set against a metal strip are two busts in garnet that are similar to a garnet and gold bust of a warrior kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. 
A mount in enameled gold and precious stones
The mount has the same characteristics as the sconce MR 251. It features small openwork leaves and enameled gold seeds. The enamel is both opaque (white, light green, light blue, mauve) and translucent (dark blue, green, orange, red, black). The enamel decoration is located at the base and runs around the mirror itself and the precious stones. The pea-pod motif -common in goldwork in the first half of the 17th century - is also present, especially on either side of the Diana cameo. The capitals and the bases of the columns also feature painted white enamel decorated with polychrome palmettes and seeds. The decoration is similar to that surrounding the base of the ewer MR 445.
A mount in the style of Delabarre
Collectors of hard stones liked to enhance them with metalwork mounts. Two styles of mount were favored in 17th-century France: the ""Delabarre"" style, after the goldsmith Pierre Delabarre, and a more classical style. The mirror in the Louvre is representative of the ""Delabarre"" style. At the time, there existed collections of model bouquets made up of small cutout leaves with trefoil, pointed, or rounded shapes, often hollowed out. Inside the bouquets were strings of seeds and pea pods. One of the ornamentalists who created such bouquets was Pierre Delabarre, who was appointed master goldsmith in Paris in 1625 and granted lodgings at the Louvre. The bouquets were reworked in precious metals by goldsmiths. The pieces of sard and the cameos are assembled on gilded brass plaques and joined up with small enameled gold leaves in the style of Delabarre - some of them hollowed out - in opaque or translucent enamel. This mount is also dotted with white seeds. This decoration is very similar to that of the sconce purchased by Louis XIV at the same time.

This still-life dating from the 1650s was painted in the city of Antwerp. The peeled lemon may be seen as a symbol of time passing.
""Still"" life
A pale wooden table is partly covered by a green cloth with a decorative gold fringe. A diverse selection of items is arranged on the tabletop. At the back stands a stemmed wine glass filled with white wine. In front of this is a vine branch supporting a bunch of white grapes, with a butterly resting at the top. To the right, a simpler glass is filled with red or rosé wine. In the foreground, jutting out slightly over the edge of the table, is a pewter dish holding a peeled lemon, cooked prawns and a few hazelnuts. Behind this is a bowl full of strawberries, and behind that, the handle of a knife.
The evocation of silence
This painting seems to express the very essence of Luxe, calme et volupté – luxury, calm and sensuous delight, to paraphrase Baudelaire's celebrated line from the Fleurs du Mal. The picture's somber atmosphere is evocative of silence, while the choice of foodstuffs and accessories expresses refinement and a love of exceptional, unusual objects – the expensive stemmed wine glass (possibly from the Orient), the knife with its finely engraved handle, the fine but carelessly crumpled tablecloth, the fruit pips scattered on the edge of the dish. The fruit is fresh and plump, and drops of sea-water have trickled from the oyster, over the edge of the table. Oysters and lemons are among De Heem's favorite motifs; the twisting spiral of the strip of lemon peel is a technical set piece of extraordinary virtuosity. The granular texture of the skin is rendered in relief, with tiny applications of thick, impasto paint – a departure from the otherwise uniformly smooth, glassy picture surface, too often often cited as the sole type of finish sought by Old Master painters of the Dutch and Flemish schools.
The theme of Vanity
De Heem is a masterly painter of light and reflections, as seen here on the dish and glasses, or the droplets of water. Here, too, we see his virtuoso rendering of the fine, misty covering of bloom on the skin of the grapes, the veins of the vine leaves, and their infinite variations of color. The picture's thriving insect population, crawling around the fruit and other objects, creates a secondary world all of its own, waiting to be discovered upon close examination by the attentive viewer. A caterpillar climbs up the vine branch, which creates a striking diagonal across the upper part of the composition. A second butterfly has alighted at the end of the branch. A spider has made its home in one of the grapes and a hornet is making its way around the edge of the bowl of strawberries. These tiny living creatures may hold some residual symbolic significance – insects are traditionally associated with the concept of vanity (from the Latin vanitas), the transience and futility of earthly life. The same concept is expressed by the withered, diseased vine leaf, the rotten grape, or the small worm-hole in the hazelnut next to the lemon. Above all, these details testify to De Heem's supreme technique and visionary approach to still-life painting, his abilty to transform one corner of a dinner-table into a small, private universe.
Jan Davidsz. de Heem succeeds triumphantly in depicting the tactile values of his chosen objects, and their slow emergence from the penumbra of the picture's plain, dark green ground. An artist of remarkable distinction, he settled in the city of Antwerp, where the practice of still-life painting took a wide variety of forms – from the art of the greatest animal painters and masters of baroque still-life (such as Jan Fyt or Frans Snyders, who often collaborated with Rubens), to the more austere output of painters such as Jacob Fopsen van Es. Their diverse images depict a world of silence and apparent stillness, imbued with tiny signs of life, and touched by the immutable forces of time and decay.

Rather than a descriptive work documenting the subject's profession or contemporary religious practice, this painting is an allegorical and moral work, condemning avarice and exalting honesty, as is shown by emblems of the vanity of life and Christian symbols like the scales of the Last Judgment. Its nature is underlined by the curiously archaic dress of the subjects, which seems to hark back to an earlier period. The mirror is a fascinating detail, reminiscent of the virtuosity of van Eyck.
Metsys in Antwerp, the economic capital of Europe
Quentin Metsys was born in Louvain in 1466. He later settled in Antwerp, where he is mentioned in 1491 as a master, and where he died in 1530. At that time, the town was a major trading center and rapidly became the principal city for commerce between northern and southern Europe. Portuguese and Spanish merchants and powerful Italian bankers visited Antwerp for trade, making the bustling city the economic capital of Europe. One consequence of the presence of merchants from all over Europe using a variety of currencies was that large numbers of moneylenders and money changers set up shop in the towns where most of the foreigners traded, such as Bruges and, above all, Antwerp. This famous painting by Metsys, once owned by Rubens, is set in one of these cities.
The moneylender and his wife
The two subjects are depicted half-length, seated behind a table. The scene is tightly framed, making them the focus of attention. They are in perfect symmetry. The man is busy weighing the pearls, jewels, and pieces of gold on the table in front of him. This is distracting his wife from the book she is reading-a work of devotion, as the illustration of the Virgin and Child shows. The mirror placed in the foreground-a common device in Flemish painting, allowing the artist to create a link with the space beyond the framed scene-reflects a figure standing in front of a window. On the right, a door stands ajar, revealing a youth talking to an old man. The artist has produced an archaic rendering of the volumes and colors, opposing red and green, for instance. This fact, as well as the minute level of detail of the objects depicted, has led some art historians to speculate that this might be an imitation of a lost work by Jan van Eyck.
A painting with a moral
The second half of the fifteenth century in northern Europe saw an expansion of genre painting-landscapes, portraits, and scenes of daily life, which artists depicted with moralizing overtones as a way of condemning human vices and reminding viewers of the frailty of human existence. These are precisely the aspects that Metsys-often considered one of the founders of the genre-highlights in this work. The shiny gold, pearls (a symbol of lust), and jewelry have distracted the wife from her spiritual duty, reading a work of devotion. The objects in the background have been carefully chosen to strengthen the work's moral message. The snuffed-out candle and the fruit on the shelf-an allusion to original sin and a reminder that we are all doomed to return to dust-are symbols of death. The carafe of water and the rosary hanging from the shelf symbolize the purity of the Virgin. Finally, the small wooden box represents a place where faith has retired. Other artists, most notably Marinus van Reymerswaele, painted many works on a similar theme.

	A classical composition

	Titian has pictured this sensuous young Venetian woman daydreaming at her toilet, holding her rope of hair in one hand and a perfume bottle in the other. She is standing, face-on, and is wearing a green dress with shoulder straps and a loose pleated white blouse which is open, revealing her left shoulder. A bearded man in a red doublet is holding two mirrors for her, one in front and the other behind. The painting is tightly focused on the two figures, which fill the entire space. The classical layout is particularly clear thanks to the harmonious way the forms echo each other. For example, the young woman's oval face and the round mirror echo the curving lines of her unclothed arm, right sleeve, plump shoulders, and generous décolleté.

	A hymn to the beauty of Venetian women

	While in this work Titian is still close to his master Giorgione in the use of the mirror and the trompe-l'oeil shelf the woman's hand is resting on, he is already distancing himself from the master in his use of a rich palette of bright colors and in the subtle play of light and shade, particularly the red garment worn by the man standing in the shadows. The work, painted while Titian was still a young man, reveals his interest in painting female portraits - he produced several such between 1510 and 1520. The young woman is leaning her head slightly to one side, and this, together with her blue eyes, pale complexion, bare shoulders, and loose, wavy, blonde hair, make her an idealized representation of Venetian beauties of the early 16th century. This fashionable theme also inspired a number of other artists, including Palma, Bordoni, and Savoldo.

This cup decorated with black figures and with a continuous curve and a rather broad, tall foot, was made by the potter Nikosthenes, who worked in Athens in the mid-6th century BC. The range of shapes he produced and the sheer size of his output make him a remarkable ceramicist. Both the inside and outside of the bowl are decorated with a rather unusual subject - two warships in full sail. Dolphins leaping beneath the handles and mermaids complete the scene.
Nikosthenes, an artist and potter
Nikosthenes (fl. 545-510 BC) owned his own workshop, where he produced and signed 139 black-figure and 10 red-figure vessels. His works are remarkable in terms of quantity, quality, and range: his output accounts for a quarter of all signed Attic black-figure vessels.He made and signed one of the earliest psykters and was the first to use Six's technique to decorate large vessels. He recreated styles of vases such as the pyxis with a tall foot, outcurving walls, and conical lids or the Nikosthenic amphora. This style of amphora is the most characteristic of his output. It has flat handles and a belly which imitates bronze vessels and Etruscan ware. The Attic black-figure version of the bucchero amphorae, made exclusively for export, shows that Nikosthenes was a shrewd businessman. He worked with Anakles, Lydos, and painters of red-figure vessels such as Oltos and Epiktetos.
The decoration
The cup is decorated with two warships on each side. On each ship, a straight stem painted with an eye for good luck stands above the prow, whose ram is shaped like a boar's head. The helmsman is standing keeping a lookout. The coxswain is standing at the stern, which is elegantly curved like a swan's neck. The ladders are fastened horizontally. The ships are being followed by dolphins. Mermaids painted on the rinceaux near the handles complete the decoration. The artist perhaps intended a reference to the story of Ulysses and the mermaids from Homer's Odyssey.
Greek ships
Successive waves of emigration encouraged Greek sailors to turn their old pentekonters - ships with one tier of fifty oarsmen - into biremes - narrow ships with two tiers of oarsmen. Biremes, with their pointed rams and fighting platforms, were perfect for waging war as well as for transport. They could maneuver very quickly using their oars and sails.In around 700-650, the Phoenicians increased the speed and tonnage of their own ships, which meant they could conquer markets further afield, blocking the ambitions their Greek rivals had to the west.In around 600, the Corinthians added a third tier of oars, not on the same vertical axis as the two lower tiers, but positioned further out over the water. These ships were extremely easy to maneuver and paved the way for the success of the third wave of Greek colonisation, and later, in 480, victory over the Persian fleet at Salamina.Archaeological digs have uncovered small models of Greek ships, often in terracotta, sometimes in ivory or bronze. The ram was given a bronze decoration, usually in the shape of a boar's head. The ships were painted in bright colours. The earliest depiction of a trireme on pottery of the archaic period dates from the early 6th century. The subject is unusual on cups but is more common on dinoi, where ships were often represented in the inside of the lip so that they looked as if they were floating once the vessel was filled.

Representations of boats appear in Cyprus towards the end of the Early Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC). The figures and the bird that appear on this model boat in painted terra-cotta have suggested a number of different interpretations ranging from the realistic, through the cultic, to the mythical. Dating from the Middle Bronze Age, this is an example of so-called White Painted ware, in which the pottery is covered with a white slip on which the decoration is applied in brown.
A maritime scene
The boat has a bulging oval hull, the raised prow and stern being indicated by round, tapering projections. On the rim, pierced with a hole in the middle of each side, are eight half-length figures in different poses, together with a bird. One figure holds its hand to its head, another has its hands on its hips, while a couple hug each other. All have slender bodies, small pinched noses, two holes for the eyes, and an incised mouth. They wear earrings, and all except one have a conical headdress adorned with circlets. These figures are decorated with horizontal bands, while the hull has a criss-cross pattern below and alternating bands of diagonals above. Painted pottery is the distinctive feature of Middle Bronze Age Cypriot civilization. The holes in this piece were probably to allow it to be hung up.
Various possible interpretations
This boat belongs to the Cypriot tradition of terra-cotta models representing shrines, other buildings, and boats, as well as groups of figurines such as the Group of Figures at a Washing Trough or the Group with Vessels. The depiction of pottery animal and human figures in the round is also characteristic of Cyprus. For some scholars, the presence of the bird - considered an attribute of the Cypriot great goddess of fertility - and the pose of the figure with a hand held to the forehead - interpreted as a gesture of adoration - suggest a religious significance. For others, the piece may represent a mythical scene comparable to the abduction of Helen. On the other hand, it may simply represent a scene from everyday maritime life.
Testimony to Cyprus's maritime trade
These boat models appear in Cyprus towards the end of the Early Bronze Age, as for example the terra-cotta ship in the Louvre (AO 17521). This impressive iconographic series continues into the Iron Age (AM 636). The images very likely testify to the regular maritime trade associated with the great cities and the production of metal.

Lambert-Sigisbert Adam was born to a family of sculptors from Lorraine. He spent ten years in Italy where he underwent the influence of Bernini; this is perceptible in his treatment of the god Neptune, portrayed standing in a twisted position with his trident in both hands. A triton at his feet leans backward, handing him a piece of coral.
A tumultuous figure
Neptune's pose is a dynamic one as he advances toward the waves, his hair and beard blowing in the wind, his drapery rippling. He steps over a triton leaning backward at his feet, and scorns the coral branch offered him (symbol of the sea's riches). With his frowning expression, his front foot placed firmly on a shell, and his hands gripping his trident, he is a magnificent incarnation of the authority of the god of the sea.
A theme familiar to the sculptor
When Lambert-Sigisbert Adam returned from Rome in 1733, Louis de Boullogne, director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, imposed the theme of the sculpture which was to be his admission piece. Although Adam's terracotta model was approved the same year (sketch approved May 30, 1733, model approved August 29, 1733), he did not finish the marble until 1737, and subsequently became a member of the Academy on May 25. Adam had already treated this theme, having sculpted a marble bust of Neptune (Berlin, Charlottenburg Palace) around 1727 while he was still resident at the French Academy in Rome. The bust and its pendant (Amphitrite) were admired and purchased by Cardinal de Polignac, a distinguished diplomat, art collector, and French ambassador to the Holy See. Despite the ten year gap, the physiognomy and expression of the two Neptunes are similar. Simultaneously to his admission piece, the sculptor treated the theme in a monumental work — the Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite. This sculpture, the central group of the Bassin de Neptune at Versailles, was completed in 1740.
A virtuoso work
Adam demonstrated his skill with this virtuoso work. It is a classical pyramidal composition, suffused with the baroque spirit — twisted body, folds of drapery, scrolls of the triton's tail, the shell and the waves, and protruding veins suggestive of effort. The naked god's contorted pose reflects the sculptor's mastery of anatomy (the most difficult of academic exercises). Adam paid great attention to details such as the scales and backbone of the triton's tails, the foam where the tails thrash the sea, and the ridges on the huge scallop shell. The panache of this group recalls Bernini's Neptune and Triton (sculpted in 1620, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although various features distinguish the two works: Bernini's Neptune is immobile, leaning out to sea, his trident poised above the waves. The major difference is one of spirit, however: Bernini's work has a more brutal strength, with a certain wildness in the facial features, whereas Adam's Neptune has something of the terribilita of Michelangelo's Moses. Adam may also have thought of the Neptune sculpted by Michel Anguier (familiar from bronze copies). Adam represented himself with this work in a Self-portrait which he drew around 1740 (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum).

240,At the Seaside…,Regulator clock,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/regulator?selection=44874,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-regulateur.jpg?1527828528,"
This regulator clock stands over two meters high on a base with lion claws. In homage to the Count of Toulouse, Admiral of France, for whom it was made, its decoration has a nautical theme, with a ship's castle, dolphins, tritons, crabs, and so on. The central section holds the pendulum, and the upper one the clock face, with the figure of Time and his scythe below it and the figure of Fame with its trumpet above it. The case is a fine example of Boulle marquetry.
History
This regulator was made for Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon (1687-1737), Count of Toulouse, the son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. It was initially placed in the Galerie Dorée, on the first floor of the Hôtel de Toulouse, which is now the Bank of France. In 1756, when an inventory was drawn up following the death of the Duchess of Penthièvre, daughter-in-law of the Count of Toulouse, the clock was found in the Grand Cabinet, next to the Galerie Dorée. During the Revolution, it was assigned to the National Printworks, which were set up in the Hôtel de Rohan. It entered the Louvre in 1915.
A clock in harmony with the paneling of the Galerie Dorée
In 1713 the Count of Toulouse bought the town house built by François Mansart in the seventeenth century, and in 1717 he started work on it. The woodcarver François-Antoine Vassé, general designer for the Royal Navy, carried out the decoration in the Gallery. He used hunting and nautical themes as a reference to the Count of Toulouse's positions as admiral and master of the royal hounds. The regulator is decorated in the same style, to match the ornamental scheme of the gallery, which was thereafter known as the Galerie Dorée, or Golden Gallery.
A timepiece in homage to the Count of Toulouse
The regulator in the Louvre is typical of the Boulle style, using shell and brass marquetry. The cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle (1642-1732) was one of the first to adapt gilt bronze for use in furnishings, thus introducing a sculptural element.                                                                        The cabinetmaker created at least three pieces of furniture in homage to the Count of Toulouse, and these, too, had nautical images as decoration. Besides the regulator, there were a pair of barometers, one of which included a thermometer.

Friedrich and German Romanticism
The painting shows a scene frequently encountered in the work of this painter, and is typical of German Romantic landscape painting. The composition is marked by simple forms and a strong coherence due to the diffuse light. The different vertical and horizontal shapes balance each other and create an atmosphere of serenity and meditation. The range of colors is limited, but treated with great subtlety.
A landscape with a religious message
The landscape communicates an authentic religious message to which each element of the composition contributes. The different naturalistic motifs painted by Friedrich are the symbols of a divine revelation. Man, facing nature, thus finds himself confronted with his condition and his destiny.
Nature, a reflection of the human condition
The foreground, which is darker than the background, features the earthly world. The fishing lines and the posts provide evidence of human toil. An almost supernatural light from above contrasts with this somber zone, and gives it an other-worldly feeling. The human condition is  represented by the fragile outlines of the fishing boats returning to port, racked by the wind and lost in the immensity of the horizon. Death is also present in the image of the stranded boat. Like an interloping ghost, it gives to the work its true depth in recalling dolefully an always imminent death. Finally, the moon whose light dominates the composition symbolizes Christ the savior of humanity, victorious over death.

A rather harsh comedy of manners (the courting couple is mirrored by an ironic pair: the dog and turkey). The Oriental or Italian-style seaport provides a highly exotic setting, to which the sculpted group of Hercules and Cacus in the background adds a pleasant touch of antique culture.
An imaginary seaport
The scene takes place in a southern port bathed in warm light. Jan Weenix was profoundly influenced by the Italianate art of his father - and master - Jan Baptist Weenix. This explains the golden tonalities of this port with its Venetian atmosphere, reminiscent of the art of Claude Gellée or Herman van Swanevelt. But this particular Italy is the fruit of the artist's imagination, and is designed to his liking: a touch of colorful exoticism with the Orientals and gondolas, the splendor of the heavy ships, an antique note with the statues (Hercules and Cacus overlooking the port, an allegory of trade in the foreground), and a glimpse inside the palatial structure on the right. The surprising still life in the foreground with its fruit and small game evokes Jan Weenix's talent for hunting trophies, an art he learned from his uncle, Gysbert d' Hondecoeter.
An amusing scene
Despite the subtle luminosity that bathes the entire painting, the characters seem to be on a theater stage, with the imaginary landscape as the backdrop for a light comedy. An ungainly little trinket seller in a ridiculous outfit (whose grotesque appearance evokes the characters of the Commedia dell' Arte) offers his wares to a rouged and powdered couple. The gentleman encourages his lady friend to take a look; she feigns indifference to these gaudy trinkets, but her eyes tell another story. The play between the little boy and the lapdog barking at the turkey in the foreground seems to be the painter's way of mocking the hypocrisy of this behavior: the turkey's rather stiff pose recalls the lady's haughty attitude - a not so flattering parallel that serves to denounce her vanity.
Theater and exoticism: the emergence of rococo
At the dawn of the eighteenth century, Jan Weenix's flavorsome composition plays on the blend of several genres, albeit with a certain artificiality: the poetic and luminous landscape, the cultured reference to antique sculpture, the still life, the Orientalizing exoticism, and the genre scene combining romantic and animal imagery. In many ways, this theatrical fantasy heralded the end of the Golden Century and the advent of the graceful developments of rococo.

The only individual work by this artist in the Louvre, this astonishingly modern drawing provides - together with the five albums also in the collection - an accurate idea of Romney's different graphic manners. Here he uses washes of sepia ink to depict the turbulence of the sea, the fury of water and sky, and the boat going down with its crew; and a biting pen to convey the power of the witch, crouching on a rocky spur with her fists clenched and her cloak swept back by the wind.
Witches
This visionary, extremely modern drawing uses the same subject as two similar studies - with the composition reversed - donated by the artist's son, the Reverend John Romney, to Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum in 1818. Given that Romney's fondness for witches dates from his return from Rome in 1775, we may fairly conclude that these works all date from about 1780. His interest in the subject never flagged, notable illustrations being the Macbeth-inspired studies of witches in a cave, executed after 1789. In addition, his son related that these washes were among Romney's favorite drawings and that they were fairly elaborate studies for a large black chalk cartoon. Unfortunately, according to William Hayley, the artist's patron, this latter was lost when Romney's studio was cleared in 1804. 
An enigmatic subject
As mysterious in its origins as in its meaning, this drawing shows a witch watching with delight a shipwreck she has caused during a storm. This scene may refer to the episode in Milton's Paradise Lost in which a witch symbolizes sin; but it could equally be drawn from the 1767 Odes to Lapland, published in Copenhagen in Danish and Latin, in which the Norwegian monk-poet Knud Leem (1697-1774), assisted by Eric Johannes Jessens (1705-1783), outlines the religious beliefs, customs, and rites of the Lapps, illustrating them with engravings. This was the only book on Lapp civilization at a time when ""Lapland"" meant any northern European country. A second edition was published in Leipzig in 1771 and an English translation appeared in The Spectator in 1778. 
Sublime and terrible
Well acquainted with subjects drawn from Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, Ovid, and Aeschylus, Romney illustrated his chosen scenes with childlike pencil drawings and the sophisticated washes of which this is an example. The medium matches the subject perfectly: combining and clashing to suggest the raging waves, the lowering sky, and the ship with the silhouettes of the crew, the single and layered sepia washes sometimes transmute into free calligraphy. By contrast, Romney brings all the force of a pitiless pen to bear on the outline of the witch, crouching on her rocky outcrop. The sheer power of this image confirms Flaxman's description of Romney's drawings as ""examples of the Sublime and the Terrible, utterly new in British art at the time""; their visionary intensity reminded him of Blake, their broad areas of shadow Cozens.

This view of a beach in Dorset, on the south coast of England, was painted about 1818-19 and exhibited at the British Institution in 1819. At the time, it was slightly smaller than it is today; two strips of canvas added by the artist at the top and on the left-hand side can just be made out. The work, in its enlarged form, was engraved at Constable's request by David Lucas as one of the illustrations for Constable's volume English Landscape Scenery.
Between landscape painting and an evocation of elemental nature
Long vistas open out in this view of a Dorset shoreline. Apart from the rocks in the foreground and the heights of a cliff on the left, nothing obstructs the view, neither the heavy sky nor the choppy sea. There is nothing but a great expanse of beach, which two figures cross. The color palette goes hand in hand with the various facets of nature depicted: meadows in the distance are rendered in greens, and the shoreline and rocks are painted in ochres, orange tones, and chestnut browns. The stark contrast between the dark blue of the clouds and sea and the white of the foam indicate that a storm is about to break. The harmonious arrangement of the various elements of nature depicted is achieved with serried ranks of paint stokes that seem to marshal the whole of the landscape. Appealing to the viewer's imagination, Constable depicted the moment before the storm.
Observation of a storm
This picture dates to about 1818-19, a moment in Constable's career when the experience of being outdoors was at the heart of his work. In developing this theme, Constable sought out different atmospheric conditions in order to capture the various moments of the day. It was a period when he was particularly fascinated by the changing sky, and when his observations of nature took on an almost scientific aspect.In 1830 Constable added two strips of canvas, enlarging the upper part and the left-hand side of the painting. In doing so, he underlined the importance to him of the sea and sky, which are the real subjects of the picture. The same principle lies behind Constable's many different views of the city of Salisbury, which he painted at different times of the year and from various viewpoints over more than thirty years. Thus we now have representations of the small city at different seasons and under a variety of weather conditions.
The triumph of English landscape painting
While there was considerable French interest in British landscape painting, many years passed before it began to exert an influence on French artists. Constable's work gained wide public attention at the Salon of 1824.At the time, English landscape painters were striving to render in detail the various aspects of landscape by painting studies in the open air, surrounded by nature. Observation was the key word in landscape painting, and the goal was to be able to focus on precise details in the painted canvas.This simple and idyllic vision of the English countryside lives on as a celebration of nature in the face of the increasing industrialization and urbanization that England underwent in the nineteenth century.

This young fisher boy with infectious good humor is a landmark in the history of art. François Rude shook the foundations of conventional classicism by the ingenuousness of his subject and his non-idealized representation of nature. The boy's gracefulness undoubtedly ensured the success of the work, which inspired several artists, particularly Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.
A Romantic manifesto
This cheerful boy, playing with a tortoise held captive by a reed, caused heated controversy at the Salon of 1833. For the first time, an artist had sculpted a lifesize marble of a picturesque figure, an anecdotal subject. It marked a complete break with classical ideology, whereby genre scenes were considered to be unworthy of statuary art, especially in a medium as noble as marble. Rude's theme and style also contradicted classical canons. Although reminiscent of antique sculpture, the work was imbued with an unprecedented feeling of freedom and freshness. The boy is naked like the heroes of mythology, but his body is not idealized and his hearty laugh reveals his teeth, a real breach of good taste. The tradition of representing children at play did exist in Hellenistic sculpture, but Rude emphasized the popular, lively aspect of his depiction. The child seated on a net is a young fisher boy, whose bonnet and scapular (the devotional object around his neck) show that he is from Naples. His attitude is carefree and his entire face - crinkled eyes, dimples, open mouth - is laughing.
The Italian picturesque
In the wake of Mme de Staël's novel Corinne, or Italy (1807), picturesque figures of country people and fishermen became for poets and artists the embodiment of simple, innocent nature, while southern Italy was regarded as its last surviving refuge. Rude, who had never visited Italy, may have drawn his inspiration from scenes of Italian folklore by the Swiss painter Léopold Robert (1794-1835). With his plaster model, executed in 1829 and shown at the Salon of 1831, the sculptor inaugurated a theme destined to be hugely successful. At the Salon of 1833, Francisque Duret (1804-1865) showed a nimble, playful Neapolitan Fisher Boy Dancing the Tarantella (Louvre). Among the many subsequent interpretations was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's outstanding Young Fisherman with Shell (Orsay, original plaster model at the Louvre). Its execution dates to the artist's first visit to Rome, where he ordered a cast of the face of Rude's Fisher Boy to be sent. Through the child's grace, naïveté, and carefree cheerfulness, Carpeaux paid a vibrant tribute to his master.
Recognition of a mature artist
Despite the objections raised by conservative critics such as Gustave Planche, Young Neapolitan Fisher Boy was a huge success. It was purchased by Louis-Philippe's administration for the Musée du Luxembourg, reserved for the works of living artists. It was the first time the State had bought a work by the sculptor, then aged forty-nine. That same year, Rude was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and he received the commission for his best-known work, The Departure of the Volunteers of 1792, also known as La Marseillaise, one of the four high reliefs on the Arc de Triomphe, in the Place de l'Étoile, Paris (plaster model of the head now at the Louvre).

This work was a gift from Pope Paul IV to the French king Henri II, and one of the first ancient statues to arrive in France. The goddess - Diana to the Romans, Artemis to the Greeks -was Apollo's twin sister. The goddess of chastity, and a tireless hunter whose arrows could punish the  misdeeds of men, she is depicted here accompanied by a deer. The statue is based on a fourth-century BC Greek bronze attributed to Leochares.
The modern history of the work
A gift from Pope Paul IV to Henri II (1556), this celebrated statue adorned a number of French royal residences. In the sixteenth century, it featured in the Jardin de la Reine at the palace of Fontainebleau. In 1602, Henri IV moved it to the Louvre, where it was displayed in the Hall of Antiquities (now the Salle des Caryatides). Under the reign of Louis XIV, it was sent to the palace of Versailles, where it was shown in the Grande Galerie. In 1798, the statue returned to the Louvre, by order of the Convention. It has been copied, cast and imitated many times in modern Europe, in engravings, ceramics and small bronzes. 
A Classical work from the fourth century BC
Artemis, the Greek goddess of hunting and twin sister to Apollo, is shown here in action, with her tunic (the chiton) tucked up to her knees to make it easier to pursue her quarry. A cape (the himation) passing over her left shoulder, clings closely to her form. The rhythmic, Classical yet naturalistic draperies, and the goddess's rather aloof majesty, allow us to date the original statue - now lost - to the second Classical period of the fourth century BC. 
A copy of an original statue by Leochares
It is tempting to date the Greek model for the statue more precisely, by attributing it to the great fourth-century BC master Leochares, a celebrated Athenian sculptor, whose work is known to us only through ancient literary and epigraphic sources. This hypothesis is based on the striking similarities between the Diana of Versailles and the famous Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican.

This sheet cutout is one of the many bronze votive objects found in the Cretan temple of Syme Viannou. These offerings were hung on the branches of trees in honor of Hermes Kedrites, a local deity associated with the cedar. The incised detail in the decoration bears the mark of the Orientalizing style that was widespread in the seventh century BC. A bearded archer welcomes a young hunter who carries a chamois on his shoulders, an offering for the god.
A Cretan ex-voto dating from the seventh century BC
This bronze cutout, purchased by the Louvre in 1884, comes from the open-air temple of Syme Viannou in Crete located on Mount Dicte. It was made circa 670-650 BC and is among the oldest of the numerous ex-votos found on this site. Dedicated to Hermes Kedrites, a local deity associated with cedar, these offerings were hung on the branches of trees, in the manner of the offerings hung in the sacred oaks of the temple to Zeus at Dodona (in Epirus). They probably relate to a rite of passage from adolescence to adulthood.
Two chamois hunters
The decoration of this votive cutout is a hunting scene, in keeping with the theme most often featured on the ex-votos found at Syme Vionnou. Two hunters move toward each other. The two men are dressed in short tunics belted at the waist, and two narrow headbands hold their hair in place, in the Cretan fashion. The elder of the two, a bearded archer, seizes the arm of his young companion in a sign of welcome. On his shoulders, the young hunter carries his offering to the god, a chamois, the animal principally associated with Hermes Kedrites. The chamois was the second most sacred animal in the Cretan religion after the bull, which continued to be used for sacrifices until the seventh century BC. Priests used the bull's horns to make bows. Archaeological excavations of the temple have revealed several horn depositories. The chamois or ibex motif is known to us in Cretan imagery as early as the late eleventh century BC. Eighth- and seventh-century representations of the animal were, however, probably influenced by Oriental prototypes diffused in the Orientalizing period, such as those featured on the Lévy oinochoe in the Louvre (E 658).
The technique of bronze sheet cutouts
The figures of the hunters and chamois were cut out of a thin sheet of hammered bronze in light relief, then worked in repoussé. The detail of the faces, the embroidered motifs of the clothing and the muscles of the two men are traced with incised lines, using a Cretan technique used up to the classical period (fifth century BC), as seen in the many objects found in the same temple. This technique, which exploits the decorative effects of the drawn figures, is analogous to that of black-figure ceramics, developed beginning in 680 BC in Corinthian workshops. The holes visible under the figures' feet suggest that the cutout was fixed onto a wooden support at its base with three rivets.

248,Hunting and Fishing,"Charles I, King of England (1600-1649), also known as Le Roi à la chasse",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/charles-i-hunt?selection=44872,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-charles-ier-roi-d039angleterre.jpg?1527830446,"
One of the masterpieces of the artist's English period, dating from about 1635. It was paid for by the king in 1638, and was meant to be a portrait of the monarch ""at the hunt,"" hence his aristocratic - and therefore elegant and distinguished - rather than specifically royal appearance (there are no monarchic insignia, merely an inscription). An unforgettable lesson in pictorial harmony between human figures (the king and equerries), animals (the horse), and landscape background.  
A gentleman out hunting
As the painter noted in a memorandum written in French in about 1638, he portrayed the king ""at the hunt."" Van Dyck, a former assistant of Rubens whose equestrian portraits were profoundly influenced by Titian, invented a highly innovative royal iconography here. The painting is not, strictly speaking, an official royal portrait. Charles I has no doubt just dismounted for a short rest while two pages are care for his horse. The king is portrayed here as a gracious gentleman, an elegant courtier like the one Baldassare Castiglione described in his famous treatise.
Regal self-assurance
But this elegant portrait, despite its apparent casualness, is nevertheless a statement of royal grandeur. As the Latin inscription, Carolus.I.REX Magnae Britanniae, proclaims, Charles I reigns supreme over Great Britain, hence over the united kingdoms of England and Scotland.The king's costume is, of course, far too luxurious for a day's hunting: wide-brimmed hat, elaborate turned-down boots, and above all the magnificent doublet on whose silvery fabric the painter displays his mastery of shimmering light effects. He artfully enhances the figure of the king by placing him to one side, well-lit and standing out against a bright sky, while his servants are in the shade on the right. The king is looking out over a coastal landscape illustrating his kingdom's diverse riches. His overall pose is a subtle compromise between gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance: one hand proudly on his hip, the other resting on his walking stick, as noble an attribute as the sword at his side. The low-angle viewpoint accentuates the king's haughty expression.
The founder of the English school
The portrait is thought to have been painted around 1635, ten years before the king's tragic death. Van Dyck had left Antwerp for London, where he had become official portrait painter to the English court. His many brilliant portraits of the British aristocracy laid the foundations of the English school. His style, oscillating between aristocratic reserve and sumptuous elegance, influenced Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. It is not known exactly how this picture found its way to France in the 17th century, but we do know that Countess Du Barry acquired it for her chateau at Louveciennes and later sold it to Louis XVI, who would suffer the same fate as Charles I.

This unique dagger from the late predynastic period consists of a light silex blade, sculpted using a highly sophisticated technique, and an ivory handle featuring carved bas-relief scenes. It is one of the oldest known examples of bas-relief sculpture. The themes come from Nilotic as well as Mesopotamian traditions: animals, the hunt, lions overwhelmed by a figure, boats, and human combats.
A luxury object
Everything in this weapon illustrates luxury and technical expertise. The blade, made of extremely high-quality, light ocher slate, reflects an accomplished mastery of stone-cutting techniques. Parallel strips were removed on one side to form a regular pattern. The other side of the blade is simply polished. Small areas were reworked to form a sharp serrated edge. Egyptian craftsmen used this meticulous technique for a short period only, between 3500 and 3200 BC. This is the most accomplished example of the silex tool making technique. Analyses of the handle determined that it is made of a hippopotamus tooth. Only a small number of ivory dagger handles of this type, decorated with relief carving, exist. These were exceptional works, reserved to an elite.
Men and animals
The blade is set into a carved hippopotamus tooth and has a central knob with a hole for attaching a cord. On one side is a bearded figure wearing a cap, standing between and subduing two lions. Below are two domesticated dogs and wild animals; a hunter seems to be catching an antelope. The other side depicts combats arranged in several registers. At the top are quasi-nude men wearing penis sheaths, in hand-to-hand combat. At the bottom, dead bodies are strewn between two different types of boats, both in use in Egypt during the Naqada period.
A key work
Animal life, hunting, and boating on the Nile are ancient themes that had already appeared on ceramics and paintings during the Naqada Period. The bas-relief carving that appeared at this time on large contemporaneous palettes depicted more dynamic and less static scenes than images on earlier traditional ceramic pieces. Furthermore, the battle theme appeared toward the end of this period, which is why researchers have tried to find a narrative link to historical events. Today they are interpreted more as referential images, a catalogue of themes that were important to the ruling class during a period when the Egyptian state was taking shape. As is often the case, certain motifs are variations of those from the contemporaneous Mesopotamian culture, such as the bearded figure of the priest king (AO5718, AO5719) and the ""Master of Animals"" figure subduing two beasts. Direct or indirect contacts certainly existed between the two civilizations. The design of superimposed registers and the conventions used to represent the human figure were used throughout the entire pharaonic period. This object illustrates the shift from the late predynastic period to the birth of the pharaonic civilization.

The slender Diana, balanced on tiptoes, seems to have been frozen in full motion. Her clean-limbed, firm figure, the way she nobly holds her head, her elegant movements, and her beauty were admired. Yet her nudity, considered improper for hunting, scandalized Houdon's contemporaries. 
Scandalous nudity
Houdon presented a life-size plaster of Diana in his studio during the 1777 Salon. The finished sculpture was to be executed in marble (Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon) for Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha, as compensation for a commission lost by the sculptor. The bronze version is now in the Louvre. The sculpture was acclaimed for its beauty worthy of classical statuary. The impression of swiftness is accentuated by Diana's slim figure. Yet her unabashed beauty caused a scandal. Diana was habitually portrayed in a short tunic belted at the waist, in the manner of the often-copied Artemis the Huntress (Louvre), a classical marble acquired by Francis I. The goddess's nudity was deemed acceptable only when she was depicted bathing. The same year as Houdon, Christophe Allegrain showed - also outside the Salon - his buxom Diana, surpised by the huntsman Actaeon while bathing (Louvre). Yet during the Renaissance, the goddess of hunting was often represented in the nude. The Diana the Huntress of the School of Fontainebleau (Louvre) and the large marble group from the Château d'Anet (Louvre) - in which the nude Diana, accompanied by her dogs, reclines, her arms around a stag - are two well-known examples.
Antiquity revisited
Houdon's wonderfully reconciles the aesthetics of antiquity and the Renaissance. From antiquity, Diana has retained her triumphant nudity, whose elegance and distinction inspires respect rather than temerity. The goddess's noble, even haughty bearing; serene, idealized face reflecting no emotion; and distant gaze render her impersonal and inaccessible. The elongation of the female body, firm anatomy, and linear purity belong to the Renaissance of the School of Fontainebleau. Her slender body, leaning slightly forward on one foot, gives the statue an ethereal and dynamic allure and affords multiple points of view. It evokes the daring balance of the flying Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna (1529-1608), a Florentine sculptor of Flemish origin who exercized considerable influence on European sculptors. But Houdon's Diana is also a full-bodied creature of the flesh. Her naked pubis, considered too realistic, was filled in and flattened in 1829.
A technical tour-de-force
The glory of the great masters of French sculpture (Girardon, Coysevox, Lemoyne, Bouchardon, Pigalle) rests on their bronze statuary, but they seem to have known little about the technical aspects of casting. Houdon, who had a passion for the art of casting, cast two large bronzes of Diana himself at the Roule foundry in Paris: an eight-piece one in 1782 (San Marino, California) and a five-piece one in 1790 (the statue now in the Louvre was purchased at auction by Charles X after the sculptor's death in 1828).

The goddess Diana rests after the hunt, assisted in her ritual toilet by a nymph. Under the veneer of the mythological subject matter, this painting is a hymn to the female body. The refined drawing, glowing skin, gentle touch, and luminous palette attest to the artist's maturity.
Back in favor
This female nude, painted in 1742, was purchased by the Louvre in 1852. It was the first Boucher painting to enter the Louvre since the early 19th century, thus marking the end of a long period when the artist's work, which the revolutionaries judged too frivolous, was out of favor. Exhibited in the Salon of 1742, Diana Leaving Her Bath belongs to a series of small paintings destined for collectors' cabinets.
A very sensual Diana
Diana frequently depicted in 18th-century French painting. In the hands of François Boucher, the huntress abandons her willful character. One can recognize the goddess by her standard attributes: the golden crescent she wears in her hair in reference to her connection with the moon, as well as the bow and recently felled game lying next to her. But most prominent here are the traits in fashion under the reign of Louis XV: the milky complexion, small full face, and curvaceous figure. Her virginal state distances her from any ill intent; she reveals her nudity with total frankness and lack of prudery, like a novice to the world of romance.
An exaltation of the female nude
Boucher is above all interested in the relationship between the body and nature. The intense blue of the drapery is offset by the rosy freshness of skin and the subtle green of the landscape. The treatment of the female nude is particularly delicate here; the modeling of the body is very sensual, as it is constructed entirely of light emanating from the left of the painting.

Has a companion piece: Hunting. The two paintings were perhaps conceived as overdoors.
A series of small fishing scenes
The painter has arranged several groups of figures in a country landscape, each group forming a small genre scene. Although artificially assembled together in the same space, the scenes seem painted from life. To the right a fisherman, still partially immersed, offers his catch to an elegant couple. In the center on the riverbank that runs the length of the composition, three figures in a boat make up a second scene: standing in the prow, a man stabilizes his boat with a pole, while a woman wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat gathers in the nets; between them, a man leaning over a large woven tray sifts through the catch. Further to the left, a young man holds a line leading into the water, while his companion prepares fish for sale. In the middle ground, the painter depicts yet other occupations, such as the two men stripped to the waist who draw in their hoop net.
The artist leads the eye
The gesture of the right figure - arms open, finger pointing - invites the viewer to enter into the painting. Carracci places the groups of figures across the full width of the work, organizing the composition in such a way that the scenes alternate on different planes. In this way, the viewer can pass from one to the other toward the painting's center without a single detail going unnoticed. The verticality of the trees contrasts with the body of water that stretches across the composition and recedes toward the background in an estuary. The colors play an important role in defining the space: speckles of white animate the surface of the water; blues and silver grays are used to render the luminous background. Annibale would often take up the ridge motif in the foreground, juxtaposed with the stretch of river, prior to this becoming one of the standard accessories of classical landscape painting. 
A new style
Annibale Carracci was 24 when he painted Fishing and its companion piece, Hunting. The two works date thus to the painter's Bolognese period, before his departure for Rome in 1584. In these paintings, Carracci endeavored to render the different activities connected with rural fishing and hunting. Figures and landscapes form a harmonious ensemble, with each small scene given equal significance. This type of subject matter was common in the villa decoration of the Bologna region where Carracci worked. Fishing and Hunting announce a new style: a meeting point of the examples of the great Renaissance masters and the direct study of nature. These two principles form the guiding strain of the teaching offered by the Carracci - Annibale, his brother Agostino, and their cousin Ludovico - at the academy they opened in Bologna circa 1585.

Designed for one of the sixteen medallions in the Room of the Winds at Palazzo del Te in Mantua, this ingenious piece was highly esteemed for several centuries. It belonged to some of the most famous collectors in France. Jabach doubtless had the original as well as a copy, which he sold to the king, and Crozat included a reproduction in an engraving in his collection. It was then purchased by Mariette. The Fishing Scene was finally purchased for the Cabinet du Roi for the sum of 351 livres.
An outward motion
Fishermen dispersed in small groups pursue their tasks along a stretch of sea. They catch a large fish (a whale?), which is portrayed by the different positions of the men pulling on lines. An interplay of biased lines is the result, which produces a rhythm that lends the scene a balanced and airy cadence punctuated by alternating movements. To the left, figures reel in a line beside another figure, who is casting his line into the water. On the bank, two groups enhance the perspective by their outward movement. The fishermen's expressions correspond, in reality, to variations of a single model. These studies of a figure in motion are placed in an ample space with an open perspective; but they end ultimately focused on the castle, the only structure unconnected with the sea.
In honor of the Marquis Federico II
This very famous piece is a preparatory study for a medallion in the Sala dei Venti (the Room of the Winds) in the Palazzo del Te palace in Mantua, which was built between 1525 and 1535 by the Marquis Federico Gonzaga. The decoration of this room and the room of the Eagles (Sala delle Aquile) was completed between September 1527 and March 1528. The Sala dei Venti is decorated in part with representations of the months and symbols of the zodiac and, above the spandrels, the winds. Located on the springing stones of the arch, the medallions evoke human activities linked to the constellations, notably that of the whale. The choice of these activities would come from the immense selection described in the Matheseos Libri VIII of Firmico Materno, even if certain authors have noted that the diversions of the court, such as hunting and fishing, are treated in a more attentive manner than others, and are situated in expansive landscapes.
The pre-eminence of the design
The frescos in the Room of the Winds are the result of the collective efforts of several of Giulio's collaborators. They include Girolamo da Pontremoli, Rinaldo Mantovano, and D'Agostino de Mozzanega, who initially was granted the entire commission. Whoever the artist may have been, the painted version respects the master's original design. Its importance is all the more significant for presenting a unity of style with a sure and rapid stroke. It demonstrates, in effect, an unusual style for Giulio, who was generally inclined to penitent subjects.

Accompanied by her two dogs, a greyhound and a water spaniel, Diana, the goddess of hunting, reclines with her arm around a majestic stag. This sculpture once surmounted a monumental fountain on the grounds of the Château of Anet, built by Philibert de L'Orme for Diane de Poitiers, Henry II's mistress. The elongated, naked silhouette of the chaste goddess, whose beauty had always been admired, became a symbol of the French Renaissance.
Diana and the Nymph
The semi-reclining figure of Diana is seen with one arm around the neck of a stag proudly holding up its head. She is accompanied by her dogs, Phrocyon and Cyrius, clearly depicted as a greyhound and a water spaniel. She is not wearing her usual attribute, the crescent moon. This figure of Diana instantly recalls the Nymph of Fontainebleau (Louvre), a high relief sculpted by Benvenuto Cellini for Francis I. Philibert de L'Orme had installed it above the main entrance to the Château of Anet in the mid-16th century, transforming the nymph into Diana, the goddess of hunting.Without being an actual portrait of the royal favorite, the figure is certainly evocative of Diane de Poitiers, mistress of the castle. The painting of Diana the Huntress (Louvre) by a School of Fontainebleau artist likewise draws parallels between the two Dianas, and the goddess is similarly depicted nude. In the Nymph relief, Cellini had specified that the stag represented Francis I. It is tempting to think that the stag here symbolizes Henry II, Diane de Poitier's royal lover.
The sculptor
The artist to whom French sculpture owes its first large-scale nude remains an enigma. The beauty of the work presupposes a great master, but which one? Its traditional attribution to Jean Goujon (not accepted today) dates back to the French Revolution and was put forward by Alexandre Lenoir, founder of the Musée des Monuments Français and an enthusiastic admirer of Goujon. Since then, the sculpture has been attributed, in turn, to Benvenuto Cellini, Germain Pilon, Pierre Bontemps, and Ponce Jacquiot. But it is hard to judge, for the statue was heavily restored in the 18th century, and then again in 1799-1800 by the sculptor Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet, also known for his interpretation of Susannah and the Elders (1813, Louvre).
Fontainebleau elegance
Whoever the sculptor of the work was, Diana epitomizes the regal elegance of School of Fontainebleau art: the elongated Mannerist figure, the litheness of the body, the tiny high breasts, the small head, the extremely refined hairstyle, and the well-drawn eyes. A certain sensuality stems from the contrast between the nakedness of the body and the elaborateness of the hairstyle, but the ideal beauty of the figure and the purity of the lines confer a chaste distinction upon the goddess.The work is a masterpiece of harmony. To balance the goddess's pose and the majestic presence of the stag with tall antlers, which draw the group to the left, the sculptor raised the goddess' left arm and placed a bow in her hand. The heads of Diana and the stag, turned in the same direction, ensure the coherence of the scene.

The so-called ""Hunting Palette"" is among the objects that feature the earliest Egyptian bas-reliefs from the late predynastic period. These were large votive stone slabs with a central circular shape. One side of this stone is decorated with a hunting scene. The clothes, weapons, and certain symbols would be recurrent themes throughout the pharaonic civilization.
Palettes for grinding eye shadow
In the late Egyptian predynastic period, during the fourth millennium BC, residents of the Lower Nile valley used stone palettes used to grind eye shadow. They were flat, elegantly sculpted, and reproduced a stylized animal shape, most often a fish, but they were sometimes fashioned into diamond or even shields-shapes topped with animal heads. We assume that the green eye shadow, made from copper ore, played an important role in their customs and must have been viewed as containing magical powers. The palettes were art objects, placed near the heads of the deceased in their tombs.
Early bas-relief sculpture
In the final phase of the so-called ""Naqada"" period, sometime after 3300 BC, palettes featuring hunting scenes were among the first examples of bas-relief art in Egypt. Some were fairly large in size and included a circular shape in the center. This is the case of the so-called ""hunting"" palette; the Louvre has one fragment of this palette, while two others are in the British Museum in London (EA 20790). The scene portrays a row of men hunting lion and antelope (London fragments). The Louvre fragment depicts a number of loin-clothed hunters wearing animal tails and carrying throw sticks and bows. The accoutrements and artistic conventions used to represent these Naqada figures were recurrent themes throughout the pharaonic era.
Between predynastic and dynastic Egypt
These historical narrative palettes were discovered in tombs and in religious edifices. These are extremely artistic, but impractical, and were probably made for gods or chiefs. They must have been limited to ceremonial or even commemorative use only. The art of relief carving developed on these large palettes as well as on dagger handles, at a time when major stone architectural structures were still nonexistent. The cosmetics palette, a characteristic object from the late predynastic period, was therefore the support for the first relief sculptures. Here, the hunting scene depicts an essential activity of predynastic society, which Egyptians during the dynastic period considered to be a manifestation of man's control over natural chaos. Hunters parade along the entire edge of the palette, while animals are relegated to the center and the edges. The action on this transportable object is composed with a disconcerting sense of freedom, as it is not conditioned by the inflexible orientation of a wall surface.

Jan Weenix, son and pupil of Jan Baptist Weenix, painted a wide range of subjects: landscapes, still-lifes, genre scenes, history paintings. During the early part of his career, he painted Italianizing scenes in the style of his father, before achieving a reputation as a talented painter of game, both living and dead. Weenix went on to become one of Holland's most celebrated painters of hunting still-lifes, as seen here.
Hunting trophies
As often in Weenix's paintings of game, and other hunting still-lifes of the time, an animal (in this case a hare) is shown hanging by one of its back legs, with its head down, as a trophy. The motif is directly related to the practice and customs of hunting with dogs. Here, the hare is hung from the top of an arched window frame opening onto a landscape, or more probably a park, dotted with large trees. The animal's head and two front legs are resting on a marble ledge. To the right of the hare, two partridges lie on top of a game bag with a large ornamental buckle. To the left, a type of hunting horn is seen sticking out. Made from carved horn, it is engraved and decorated with a braid tassel. The warm, red tones of the hare's fur, the colored feathers on the partridge's wing, the rough braid and the flaming sky – lit by the light of the setting sun – are heightened and contrasted with the white highlights of the hare's underbelly, the bird's plumage, and the canvas lining of the game bag (bottom right). The window ledge itself is made from a slab of red and white-veined marble. The painting's color scheme is clearly redolent of raw meat and blood – the essence of hunting – but this is more than counterbalanced by the refinement of the composition and details, and the overall sense of inexpressible harmony and aesthetic perfection.
A decorative function
Clearly, hunting still-lifes differ from everyday kitchen scenes – they illustrate an important aspect of the lives of a highly privileged social class. Hunting trophies such as this were often painted for the townhouses or castles of wealthy patrons – Weenix himself painted a series of panels for the audience chamber and anterooms at Schloss Bensberg, near Cologne. In this way, aristocratic patrons were able to advertise their passion for hunting. Ostentatious depictions of game, together with gamebags and other accessories, in sophisticated, luxurious settings, were seen as potent symbolic expressions of aristocratic wealth, pride and land ownership.
Father and son
Jan Weenix painted a wide variety of subjects throughout his career, but he was best-known for his hunting scenes, open-air depictions of game trophies, and still-lifes with game. Weenix was employed to produce decorative canvases for a number of fine townhouses in Amsterdam, but his most celebrated decorative scheme was a series of twelve large-format canvases commissioned by the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm von Neuburg-Wittelsbach for two galleries in his castle at Bensberg, near Düsseldorf (fragments of these canvases are preserved at the Alte Pinakotek in Munich). Weenix's attentive, sustained study of his father's works led him to paint compositions in the same Italianizing manner, however hunting trophies and still-lifes remained his personal specialty. He excelled at the rendering of texture, and the use of opulent, profuse color.

The heron hunt is also a political allegory. On the left, on horseback and wearing a hat, is Archduke Leopold-William, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands until 1656; in the background is the capital, Brussels. In the emblematic language of the time, the struggle between heron and falcon symbolizes a struggle of uncertain outcome, favorable here to the heron (Flanders), under attack from French falcons to the south and Dutch ones to the north and still managing to survive.
Falcon hunting
The painting depicts that most aristocratic of activities, falconry. The horseman on the far left is Archduke Leopold William, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, accompanied by two courtiers. Brussels, the archduke's city of residence, can be seen on the horizon behind them. On the right, a hunter runs towards a vicious fight taking place between a heron and two falcons in the middle of the picture. Their struggle is portrayed in extremely naturalistic style. One of the falcons, its back to the ground, claws the air as it faces the heron's violent attack while the other, wings outstretched, ferociously pecks at the heron from behind.
A subtle political allegory
Despite the realistically depicted aerial combat and the naturalism of the birds, we are struck by the disproportionate scale in the composition. The birds are far too large in relation to the picture's other elements, and this is accentuated by their central position. This emphasis on the birds invites us to view see the scene as more than a mere depiction of the noble art of falconry. The explanation for this is found in a book of emblems, Camerarius' Symbolorum et Emblematum. The combat between heron and falcon is used to illustrate the uncertain outcome of battles, in which ""it is not rare that he who was on the verge of conquering is conquered."" The heron therefore embodies the resistance of the Spanish Low Countries, defended by Leopold William, during the uneven war against France and the Netherlands who were attacking from north and south, just like the falcons who seem to be fighting together. The struggle was still undecided, and all hopes rested on the archduke's victories.  
A restricted and delicate palette
Teniers the Younger is famous today above all for his depictions of amusing popular subjects such as village fairs, cabarets and peasant festivities. This picture, painted while he was in the service of Leopold William, shows another aspect of his art. He painted several portraits of the archduke, celebrating his feats of arms and his informed patronage. But here, more subtly elogious, he renews the landscape with figures genre. His palette is restricted and based essentially on grayish hues: the silvery green of the leaves and the gray blue of the sky, echoed by the heron's plumage. Tenier's ample, light treatment creates a delicate shimmering light and demonstrates his talents as a landscape painter.

Like its now lost companion piece, Death of a Stag, this presentation of the good life in high society was painted for the dining room in the King's private apartment at Fontainebleau, where it was hung with Charles André Vanloo's Halt during a Hunt and Charles Parrocel's Halt of the King's Mounted Grenadiers, both now in the Louvre
The hunt as pretext
Hunt Breakfast was painted in 1837 for the main dining room in Louis XV's suite at Fontainebleau. This lightweight example of the history painter's art points up the change of taste in interior decoration that came with the Regency, with pastoral and the hunt replacing the mythological imagery of the past. The royal hunt had already made its appearance in such works as Bernard Van Orley's Hunts of Maximilian, but with the emphasis on the hunt itself. Here we see the pause, pretext for an outdoor meal in which action is supplanted by the pleasures of the table, flirtation and amorous plotting.  
A master of all genres
Son of the portraitist François de Troy, the artist set out to become the leading painter of his generation. Although he ultimately fell victim to Neoclassical reaction, he remains one of the 18th century's great history painters and had a considerable influence on the young Joseph-Marie Vien. Born in Paris in 1679, Jean-François de Troy studied with his father before spending the years 1699-1706 in Italy. Returning as an admirer of Veronese and Titian, he was admitted to the Academy of Painting and Sculpture as a history painter. While the creator of such large religious works as Christ before Pilate, also in the Louvre, he excelled in all the genres - lovers' trysts, portrayals of fashion, mythology, portraits - while drawing on a visual repertoire that was often a pretext for showing the female nude. He contributed to the decoration of the royal apartments, one example being this Hunt Breakfast, created for the palace at Fontainebleau. Deeply disappointed at not receiving major commissions, de Troy painted seven tapestry cartoons for the royal Gobelins manufactory. His Story of Esther series enjoyed great success and was woven several times in the course of the 18th century.  
Last years in Rome
Appointed director of the French Academy in Rome, de Troy moved there in 1738 and designed a new series of tapestry cartoons. However, his Story of Jason and Medea was badly received at the 1748 Salon and, falling from favor, he was replaced at the Academy by Charles-Joseph Natoire. He stayed on in Rome, where he died in 1752.

Chariot  scenes were one of the favorite subjects of the relief art that reached its apogee in the independent principalities that emerged in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria after the fall of the Hittite Empire in about 1200 BC. A particularly brilliant school of sculpture developed in the kingdom of Milid (Malatya), as is witnessed by this relief of a deer hunt, in which the legacy of Hittite art combines with influences from Mesopotamia and Syria.
A deer hunt
The hunting of deer is a very old theme in the iconography of the Hittite world, and is depicted as conducted from a chariot in this orthostat relief discovered at Malatya in southeastern Anatolia. Such bas-relief slabs were applied to the lower part of the walls in palaces and official buildings. While they had a decorative role, they were also functional, protecting the base of a wall constructed of unbaked brick.
The influence of Assyrian relief
Despite the fall of the Hittite Empire in about 1200 BC, in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria Hittite culture survived in a series of successor principalities. Malatya, the kingdom of Milid, was one of the most flourishing of these small Neo-Hittite kingdoms. In the 11th century BC, a school of sculpture that continued to work with the traditional forms of Hittite relief was estabished there. This deer hunt relief is, however, more recent, betraying the growing influence of the Assyrian Empire on the kingdom even before it fell under the Assyrian sway in the 8th century BC.
A war chariot
Inscribed with the name of Maradash, a king of Milid whose precise regnal dates are unknown, this relief shows two figures dressed in the local style riding on a light chariot. This type of chariot with its single axle had relatively small wheels with only six spokes. A spear or pike can be seen in the back of the chariot and two crossed quivers are fastened to the side: these details allow the relief to be dated to around the 11th century BC. Though these fast and maneuverable chariots might be used for hunting, their main role was military. In accordance with a convention later abandoned, only one horse is shown, although there were in fact a pair. As the bowman prepares to shoot his arrow, the driver has the reins firmly in hand, matching his speed to that of the fleeing deer; the hunters are accompanied by a dog. Above the horse's back can be seen the rigid pole of the chariot. The horse has no bit, and the reins seem to be fastened directly to the bridle; a belly band with two pompoms can be seen behind the shoulder, while the head would have been crowned with a plume.

This fragment of an Old Kingdom mastaba includes a total of ten fish, all clearly identifiable and depicted with careful attention to detail, together with a frog, a hippopotamus, and a crocodile. The scene depicts the natural environment of the Nile marshes, a source of both recreation and sustenance for the tomb's noble occupant, during his life. 
A detail from a larger scene
This fragment comes from the wall of a funerary chapel, one of the mastabas (or superstructures) that surmounted the sepulchers of prominent figures during the Old Kingdom. The principal figure - the owner of the tomb - is lost apart from his left foot, standing in the bow of a small boat. The boat 'floats' on a line in horizontal relief, representing the water-line, above and below which finely-painted vertical waves indicate the waters of the Nile, full of fish. A variety of Nile algae, known as Potamogeton lucens, emerges above the surface, with a tiny blue frog seated among its fronds.The vertical representation of the river surface, around the central figure, has enabled the artist to depict his hero in a proud, upright stance, harpooning the fish horizontally, with no need to stoop towards the water. The upper section of the scene has been lost; all that remains is a small harpoon, probably held by a secondary figure. 
A densely-figured fragment
The artist uses the low relief technique to differentiate between the underwater and surface features of the scene. Figures and motifs on or near the surface are carved in low relief and painted; fauna beneath the water are rendered with paint alone, except for the hippopotami and the crocodile, whose contours are lightly incised. Modern viewers may be surprised by the disregard for scale in the depiction of the various figures. The harpooner's foot is disproportionately large, and the fish are as large as the hippopotami and the crocodile. Ancient Egyptian art does not seek to provide a visually-accurate depiction of a coherent scene; it should be ""read"" as a kind of pictorial notation, juxtaposing the objects observed. The central message in this work is the depiction of the fauna, the center of the action. In this context, the scene provides an accurate and exceptionally well-preserved illustration of the natural history of the Nile marshes.The animals depicted are, from left to right, a Mormyrus (recognisable by its trunk-like snout), a catfish, two hippopotami and a mullet. In front of the crocodile are a Citherinus latus, a Malopterurus electricus, and a Nile perch. Above the boat, from left to right: a Tetrodon fahaka, a second Mormyrus, an eel, a Synodontis batensoda, and a Tilapia nilotica.
The Nile marshes: a richly-symbolic world
To the ancient Egyptians, who made the transition from a nomadic to a settled existence as farmers in the Nile Valley, the residual marshes were the waterland from which life sprang when the world was created. They were also an important source of sustenance: the habitat of the fish that were a staple food. For high-ranking civil servants, fishing and hunting were also highly-prized leisure activities in the cool, restful marsh environment. Images such as this reproduce the typology of official scenes showing the Pharaoh engaged in similar activities - a personification of Egyptian mastery over the natural world. In the context of a mastaba, scenes such as this are intended to represent a source of life and renewal.

In his reception piece to the Académie, Desportes breaks with the tradition of atelier self-portraits. Instead, he gives himself the air of a man of quality, a lover of the hunt and nature. The meticulously rendered dogs and game are a direct allusion to his specialty as a painter of animals. 
An uncompromising self-portrait
This painting, with its brilliant execution and sense of color, is as successful in its treatment of the subject - it is an uncompromising self-portrait - as in its rendering of animals or landscape. This is the first important work by a painter who would go on to incarnate the century of Louis XV and develop his talent in themes of the hunt. In order to achieve perfection in the treatment of animals, landscapes, and accessories, Desportes worked a great deal from nature, creating numerous animal sketches and outdoor oil studies.
A reception piece
This is the reception piece offered to the Académie Royale by François Desportes, an early 18th-century painter of animals. The work remained in the Académie Collection until it entered the Muséum Central des Arts during the French Revolution in 1793. The Muséum would later become the Louvre.

262,Hunting and Fishing,Neapolitan Fisherboy Playing with a Turtle by the Sea,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/young-neapolitan-fisherboy-playing-tortoise?selection=44872,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-pecheur-napolitain-jouant-avec.jpg?1527825244,"
This young fisher boy with infectious good humor is a landmark in the history of art. François Rude shook the foundations of conventional classicism by the ingenuousness of his subject and his non-idealized representation of nature. The boy's gracefulness undoubtedly ensured the success of the work, which inspired several artists, particularly Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.
A Romantic manifesto
This cheerful boy, playing with a tortoise held captive by a reed, caused heated controversy at the Salon of 1833. For the first time, an artist had sculpted a lifesize marble of a picturesque figure, an anecdotal subject. It marked a complete break with classical ideology, whereby genre scenes were considered to be unworthy of statuary art, especially in a medium as noble as marble. Rude's theme and style also contradicted classical canons. Although reminiscent of antique sculpture, the work was imbued with an unprecedented feeling of freedom and freshness. The boy is naked like the heroes of mythology, but his body is not idealized and his hearty laugh reveals his teeth, a real breach of good taste. The tradition of representing children at play did exist in Hellenistic sculpture, but Rude emphasized the popular, lively aspect of his depiction. The child seated on a net is a young fisher boy, whose bonnet and scapular (the devotional object around his neck) show that he is from Naples. His attitude is carefree and his entire face - crinkled eyes, dimples, open mouth - is laughing.
The Italian picturesque
In the wake of Mme de Staël's novel Corinne, or Italy (1807), picturesque figures of country people and fishermen became for poets and artists the embodiment of simple, innocent nature, while southern Italy was regarded as its last surviving refuge. Rude, who had never visited Italy, may have drawn his inspiration from scenes of Italian folklore by the Swiss painter Léopold Robert (1794-1835). With his plaster model, executed in 1829 and shown at the Salon of 1831, the sculptor inaugurated a theme destined to be hugely successful. At the Salon of 1833, Francisque Duret (1804-1865) showed a nimble, playful Neapolitan Fisher Boy Dancing the Tarantella (Louvre). Among the many subsequent interpretations was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's outstanding Young Fisherman with Shell (Orsay, original plaster model at the Louvre). Its execution dates to the artist's first visit to Rome, where he ordered a cast of the face of Rude's Fisher Boy to be sent. Through the child's grace, naïveté, and carefree cheerfulness, Carpeaux paid a vibrant tribute to his master.
Recognition of a mature artist
Despite the objections raised by conservative critics such as Gustave Planche, Young Neapolitan Fisher Boy was a huge success. It was purchased by Louis-Philippe's administration for the Musée du Luxembourg, reserved for the works of living artists. It was the first time the State had bought a work by the sculptor, then aged forty-nine. That same year, Rude was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and he received the commission for his best-known work, The Departure of the Volunteers of 1792, also known as La Marseillaise, one of the four high reliefs on the Arc de Triomphe, in the Place de l'Étoile, Paris (plaster model of the head now at the Louvre).

263,Writing,"Lettre de Biridiya, prince de Megiddo, au roi d'Egypte",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/amarna-letter-pharaoh-governor-megiddo?selection=44870,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-lettre-biridiya-prince-megiddo.jpg?1527821517,"
The letters discovered in the archives at Amarna - the short-lived capital of Egypt under the pharaoh Akhenaton - provide evidence about international relations in the Near East in the 14th century BC. Written in cuneiform, they use Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. This letter, from the governor of Megiddo, a city on the Syro-Palestinian coast, illuminates the way in which the pharaoh's Levantine territories were exploited for his benefit.
The Amarna archives
The ""Amarna Letters"" are cuneiform tablets discovered in the new capital built by Amenophis IV, who called himself Akhenaton (1365-1349 BC). The site is renowned for its frescoed palaces and for the royal sculpture workshop in which were found moving portraits of the pharaoh, his children, and his beautiful wife Nefertiti. These tablets are written in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time, and contain the official correspondence addressed to the pharaoh by the dynastic rulers of Syria and Palestine. Some date back to the reign of Amenophis III (1403-1365 BC), the most brilliant ruler of the New Kingdom; they were probably conveyed there along with the royal archives when Akhenaton decided to take his leave of Memphis and its conservative priesthood in order to promote the new religion of Aten (Aton), the solar disk. 
Diplomatic correspondence
Rare are the ancient documents that speak in the voice of the actors themselves: from the whole of the 2nd millennium BC in the Levant there survive only the archives of Mari, Ugarit, and Amarna. These texts tell us less about current events than about the relationships between states and the subtle hierarchy that existed among them, reflected in strictly codified formulae of address and greeting, which testify to an implicit consensus regarding the recognition and status of suzerains, great states, and lesser principalities. The subjects covered by the letters are diverse, ranging from requests for protection to the regulation of the trade in goods and the circulation of caravans. The letters from Palestine were written by governors appointed by the pharaoh in territories then directly controlled by Egypt: Biridiya, governor of Megiddo, is also known from other documents. Two of the localities mentioned can probably be identified with the cities of Jaffa and Shunamma. This particular letter is interesting for the information it gives on the exploitation of these territories for the pharaoh's benefit and on the place of forced labor in this.
To the pharaoh, from Biridiya
One thus finds: ""Say to the king, my lord, my sun: a message from Biridiya, loyal servant of the king. At the feet of the king my lord, my sun, I prostrate myself seven times and seven times. May the king my lord think upon his servant and his city. In fact, I alone am cultivating: ah-ri-shu in Shunamma and I alone furnish forced laborers. But behold the mayors near me. They do not do as I do. They do not cultivate in Shunamma, they do not furnish forced laborers. I alone ia-hu-du-un-ni I all alone furnish forced laborers. They come from Jaffa from among the men available and from Nuribta. And may the king my lord take thought of his city.""

264,Writing,Cylindres de Gudea,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cylinders-gudea?selection=44870,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-cylindres-gudea.jpg?1527822112,"
Mesopotamian history was marked by the rulers' constant desire to be seen as meritous by the gods and glorious by their subjects. One way they fulfilled this desire was by commissioning great buildings. These two cylinders were commissioned by King Gudea of Lagash, who ruled in around 2100 BC, as a literary and historical record of the construction of the temple of Ningirsu and the enthronement of the divine king and queen of Lagash during the ceremony to mark the new year. 
Cylinder A: The principal phases of the construction of the temple of Ningirsu
The decoration of Cylinder A refers both to human and divine involvement in the construction. It records the god Enlil's order to Ningirsu ""to build a temple in our city [Girsu]"" and that ""a prince of great understanding will apply his understanding"" to the project. Ningirsu immediately appeared to Gudea in a dream to inform him about the temple, describing how it should look, and telling him of his future glory: ""I will spread the respect for my temple over the whole world, the whole universe from the far horizon will gather there in my name, and even [the distant lands of] Magan and Meluhha will leave their mountains and come to it"" (cylinder A, IX). As Sumer was rich in farmland but poor in building materials, Gudea ordered wood, metal, bitumen, and blocks of stone for the temple from as far away as the shores of the Mediterranean and the Indus valley. When the materials were finally all delivered to Lagash, Gudea ordered a purification ceremony for the city and its inhabitants, and then set to work to build a majestic temple to the god. Cylinder A should be read in parallel with the inscription on the statue of Gudea known as the Architect with a Plan (AO2).
Cylinder B: The enthronement of the divine couple in the temple and the ceremony of the sacred marriage
Cylinder B records the episodes after the completion of the temple, when the god and his paredra, the goddess Bau, were officially invited to take possession of the temple. The major rite led up to the hierogamy, or sacred marriage, of the divine couple. This was a fertility rite which guaranteed the renewal of life in all its forms - human, animals, and plants. When the goddess married her paredra, the sun returned to Sumer, providing abundant crops for the following year. Gudea provided Ningirsu with divine and human servants responsible for food, war, agriculture, fishing, and building, giving them powers as far as the borders of his state, including the plains, swamps, and fields. The wedding scene, shrouded in mystery, is mentioned in just a few brief lines. Next comes the ritual meal, after which ""the rites have been completed and the decrees fulfilled."" Thanks to the prince's actions, his kingdom will enjoy a time of plenty, all inequalities between master and slave, the weak and the strong, will be done away with, widows and orphans will be protected, and justice will be done.The rite of the sacred marriage was practised throughout the Mesopotamian era. It was celebrated at the new year - in other words, in the springtime - so that the wedding was renewed annually, bringing life back to the parched land. At the ritual wedding, the king represented the dead god brought back to life. The Sumerians called the god Dumuzi and the Akkadians Tammuz.
The inscriptions recording Gudea's building program
Gudea's reign was dominated by the reconstruction of the temple of Ningirsu, tutelary god of Lagash. Gudea had a number of commemorative inscriptions built into the temple, in the foundations, beneath the doors, and in the walls. These mainly take the form of bricks with hand-written or stamped inscriptions, stone or metal tablets, copper figurines ending in a point like nails, and clay cones and nails whose head was designed to stick out of the wall.

This decree, concerning the financing of work on the embellishment of the Acropolis, was drawn up after a proposal by Kallias and shows how public life was organized in Athens during the classical period. The script is characteristic of the late fifth century BC.
An Athenian decree
This Athenian decree governs the organization of public finances at the end of the fifth century BC. It orders the return of loans made by the people of Athens to the treasurers of the sanctuaries, in order to finance work on the embellishment of the Acropolis and other city sites, such as the arsenal and the city walls. The law also provides for changes in the way the riches of the gods are managed.
The organization of Athenian institutions
The inscription describes the functioning of the Athenian institutions. The city council (the boule) would propose a draft law (""probouleuma"") to the popular assembly (""ekklesia""). In this instance, the man proposing the law (called a ""rogator"" in Latin) is an Athenian politician by the name of Kallias. The ten Athenian tribes represented on the council would each provide fifty councilors (""prytaneis""), and would take it in turn to preside over the council for a tenth of a year each, under the authority of a president (""epistate""). In this instance, the president is Eupeithes of the Cecropes tribe (named after Cecrops, the legendary first king of Athens). All this is mentioned in the title of the decree, so that the responsible parties (in particular, the ""rogator"") could be identified should a charge of illegality be brought against the law, following a procedure called ""graphe paranomon"", whereby any citizen could contest a law after it had been passed.
The script
The dating of the piece, which it is difficult to establish precisely, is based partly on the script of the Greek inscription. The letters are superposed in columns, in a regular script called ""stoichedon"" in Greek. The spelling and the old style of certain letters (Λ, the ""lambda"", Ν, Ι for γ, λ, ν, ζ) mean that the decree was engraved before the reform carried out by Eukleides in 403 BC.

Holbein shows the famous Dutch humanist writing his commentary on Saint Mark's Gospel in Paraphases on the New Testament, as comparison with a very similar painting in Basle confirms. Holbein's very sober composition focuses on the face and hands to reflect the model's concentration. The portrayal in profile is a clear allusion to the effigies of Roman emperors engraved on antique medals. 
A humanist at work
Holbein's portrait is one of the best known portrayals of Erasmus (Rotterdam, 1469 - Basle, 1536). He portrays the famous Dutch humanist, who was also one of the great moralists of the Renaissance, in an interior, against a green wallcovering decorated with legendary animals and yellow and red flowers, with possibly a door jamb on the right. The scholar, wearing warm clothes and a biretta, is writing on a sheet of parchment laid on a book with red binding, propped at an angle.The Basle Museum has another portrait of Erasmus by Holbein, in which Erasmus is portrayed against a neutral backdrop. In the Basle picture the humanist is writing the beginning of his commentary on Saint Mark's Gospel, written in 1523 and published the following year by his friend Johann Froben. It was probably through Froben that Erasmus met Holbein, then a young man, in Basle. Comparison with the few downstrokes still visible in the Louvre painting have established that the text is identical to the passage in the Basle painting.
An official yet intimate portrait
The eye is drawn to Erasmus's face in profile, eyes cast downwards, which stands out against the dark green wall hanging. Our attention is also focused on the finesse of his hands, which Holbein took great care over, as we can see from a study in the Musée du Louvre. The sober composition emphasizes the model's concentration on his writing. The choice of the profile portrait, rare for Holbein, is a clear allusion to the effigies of Roman emperors engraved on antique medals. Despite its intimacy, this portrait has a very offical look about it. Holbein's portrait is a veritable icon of this great man of letters, whose slightly pursed lips express his moral exigency. Erasmus, who paid great attention to his public image, and who was very disappointed by Dürer's uncompromising portrait of him, must have appreciated this skilful, calm picture.
A memento for a friend and fellow humanist?
We know of three portraits of Erasmus painted by Holbein whose intended recipients are still unsure. It is thought the Basle portrait was taken by the painter to the court of Francis I of France in an unfruitful attempt to secure his protection there. Erasmus himself sent two portraits to acquaintances in England. The portrait now in the National Gallery, London, was undoubtedly a gift to William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury. It is possible that Erasmus intended to give the Louvre painting to another humanist, perhaps his faithful friend Thomas More (an attractive but unproven hypothesis). On Erasmus' recommendation, the famous author of Utopia became Holbein's protector in England, and ensured his introduction at court.

This tablet inscribed in Old Persian is one of the first texts drawn up by Darius I on his accession to power. It is the foundation charter of his palace at Susa. Found buried under one of the gates into the Apadana, it provides valuable information about the Darius's titles and the construction of his palace.
The construction of the palace of Darius
After invoking the protection of the god Ahura Mazda and listing the titles and lineage of King Darius, the text of the charter deals with the construction of his palace, describing first the excavation work carried out to build the foundations. It goes on to enumerate the materials used and their geographical origins. The building materials came from all over the kingdom, notably the precious materials used for the decoration: gold, lapis lazuli, turquoise, silver and ebony. Finally, the text recognizes the contribution of the various population groups in the empire, according to specialty: the stone cutters were Ionian and the gold and silversmiths from Media and Egypt.
A foundation object
Since the time of the archaic dynasties, it had been the tradition in Mesopotamia to bury a foundation tablet under the thresholds of palaces. This document invoked the protection of the gods and recorded the important events that took place during the construction. The Achaemenian kings upheld this custom. This baked-clay tablet was found in fragments under a gate to the Apadana at Susa in 1911 by Roland de Mecquenem.
An inscription in Old Persian
Written in Old Persian, this tablet is inscribed with cuneiform characters that obey a structure close to the alphabetical system, which had not been used before Darius' time. In the Achaemenid period, royal texts were drawn up in the three official languages of the empire: Elamite, Babylonian and Old Persian, the language of the Persians, the dominant ethnic group of the kingdom. Many specimens of this charter were found in the two other languages, transcribed on documents that were intended to be seen (Louvre Museum, sb9746 and sb9722). The various versions were translated, commented on and published in 1929 by Father Jean-Vincent Scheil, Assyriologist and decipherer of cuneiform texts found at Susa.

After death, Egyptians hoped to reach a sort of paradise they called the Fields of Offerings - a land of abundance where barley was five cords (2.5 meters!) high, and wheat seven cords (3.5 meters) high. Chapter 110 of the Book of the Dead, a papyrus scroll, is illustrated with a map of this ideal countryside; the right to enter guaranteed prosperity and protected against hunger.
An Illustrated Fragment of the Book of the Dead
In antiquity, a papyrus book was a scroll that was unrolled on one side and rolled up on the other as it was read. The museum exhibits fragments that were once divided in this way. The Book of the Dead, a collection of formulae, was placed in the tomb of the deceased as a means of protection. It is illustrated with more or less standard illuminated drawings and paintings. Most of these vignettes are small and placed at the top of the page or within the body of the text. Some, like the work in the Fields of Reeds (or Fields of Offerings) from Chapter 110, are full-page illustrations.
Obtaining Food by any Means
The book is known in Egyptian as the ""Book of the Coming Forth by Day."" By leaving his tomb - through the use of magic spells or formulae - the deceased was able to enjoy the food placed in his tomb by his heirs or could sample the food on the altars of sanctuaries, where he was a protégé and guest of the gods. Finally, he could go to the Fields of Offerings, where he had his own personal homestead and payments in kind. Chapter 110 begins with these words: ""Here begin the spells for the Fields of Offerings, the spells for coming forth by day, to enter and leave the world of the dead, to travel to the Fields of Reeds, to meet in the Fields of Offerings, the great place of winds, and there to be powerful, blessed, to work, to harvest, to eat, to drink, to make love, to do everything one does on earth."" We can see that these fields constitute a land of plenty, a paradise and a second way, after coming forth by day, for the deceased to continue to live as if death had not occurred.
An Elysian Egyptian Landscape
The spell is illustrated by a sort of geographic plan of these fields, complete with the primary places of interest and activities, as on some of our tourist maps. During the Late Period, it was divided into three registers. The main deities are enthroned at the top, where the deceased pays them homage. The fields are represented in the middle; and at the bottom, a meandering of canals irrigates the fields, while boats and cities are depicted along the banks.The deceased could avoid agricultural work in the collective interest by paying replacement workers, thereby shunning such chores (Chapter 6, the funerary servants). Yet he seems to take pleasure in the same tasks here. Dressed in his Sunday best, he digs, plants, and harvests grains in the land granted to him (although the text guarantees that Horus's servants will perform the work for him). The work must have been highly profitable, as the barley is five cords (2.5 meters) high, with sheaves two cords high, and stalks reaching to three cords. The wheat is seven cords high (sheaves three cords highs; stalks four). Land ownership in an essentially agricultural country - with no system of currency and virtually none of trade - represented the ultimate wealth, providing the best protection against famine.

Few of Strozzi's drawings survive. The Louvre acquired twelve of them in 1981.This one, from the ""Borghese album,"" was attributed to the artist in the eighteenth century because of the annotation on the back - ""P.G. Prete genovese"" (the Genoese priest) - an allusion to the fact that the artist was once a member of a religious order. This skillfully executed work is of major significance, attesting to the sophistication and culture of Strozzi, who was influenced by seventeenth-century masters.

The man's face is turned three-quarters to the right, while the rest of his body faces the opposite direction. The reaction of sudden surprise, emphasized by the gleam in the eyes and parted lips, has not yet pervaded the entire body. The man holds his pen tightly in his hand, and the position of the torso and shoulders suggests deep concentration. The strokes used to render the flowing hair are swift, long, and fluent, giving the figure a very elegant air. The face, in contrast, is characterized by darker and shorter strokes in the darker or more descriptive parts, as, for example, the hairs on the chin. The artist skilfully suggests areas of light emerging from between the black chalk outlines; the luminous effect is accentuated by the white highlights. Furthermore, the evocation of light and the way in which the shadows are rendered indicates that the drawing was studiously prepared.
Genoa or Venice?
Although the attribution of this drawing has never been questioned, determing the period of the artist's career in which it was executed is more complicated. The drawing was thought to date from Strozzi's Genoese period, when he was exposed to influences from Tuscany and Lombardy as well as foreign ones - notably that of Peter Paul Rubens, who was in Genoa at the time. According to this hypothesis, the Louvre drawing was a preliminary study for a portrait of Saint John the Evangelist that is now kept in the Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum in Hanover. However, a more recent suggestion puts the date for this drawing and its painted version back to circa 1620, during the artist's Venetian period. This opens up an interesting interpretation of the purpose of the drawing.
A didactic purpose
It is thought that this drawing, like others, was part of a book of drawings designed for use by pupils of the master, who could thus learn and practise the art of draftsmanship using a resource put together for them. These drawings, selected by Strozzi himself, served an instructional purpose, in accordance with a procedure that had already been developed in the Academy of Drawing. The presence of details, whether Genoese or Venetian, apparently demonstrates that the drawing belongs to Strozzi's Venetian period - the painting must date from that time, given the nature of the draftsmanship and the color scheme.

This large, silver-gilt inkstand was made for export by Thomas Germain, silversmith and sculptor to the king, and bears the arms of Cardinal da Cunha, a member of an eminent Portuguese family. The craftsmanship is consumately skilled and extremely ornate. Entirely chased and decorated with serrated foliage, it is emblematic of the rococo style and of the role played by Thomas Germain in its dissemination. 
A gift to Cardinal da Cunha
The arms of Cardinal da Cunha can still be read beneath the cardinal's hat on the sides of the stand. They can also be seen on the lid of the orginal red Morocco leather cover (likewise in the Louvre). Cardinal da Cunha, a member of an illustrious Portuguese family, was related to an ambassador to the French Court, Luiz da Cunha, who died in Paris in 1749. The cardinal received this inkstand as a gift. We know that the city of Paris offered silver inkstands made by Thomas Germain as gifts on several occasions. The Parisian silversmiths, and particularly the Germains, supplied numerous works for foreign clients, and it was through these exchanges that the rococo style was disseminated throughout Europe.   
A rococo inkstand
The inkstand consists of a chased stand, recipients, and writing instruments. In the middle is a sponge holder surmounted by a hand bell, and, to either side, the inkwell and sandbox (sand was used to dry the ink). The stand itself has involuted legs, and its curved edges decorated with moldings give the ensemble an extremely lively appearance. The top of the stand is covered with fluting and acanthus leaves chased in very shallow relief. The sponge holder has been given the form of an ornate architectural plinth and is flanked by intricately sculpted and chased acanthus leaves that link it to the inkwell and sandbox. The inkwell and sandbox are entirely covered with cabled fluting, and their lids are surmounted by a bunch of grapes. All these detailed and naturalistically rendered ornaments form part of the rococo repertoire and are to be found on the tableware pieces Thomas Germain executed during the same period. The exquisite elegance of the inkstand is characteristic of this silversmith's virtuoso craftsmanship.

The Law Code of Hammurabi is the emblem of the Mesopotamian civilization. This high basalt stele erected by the king of Babylon in the 18th century BC is a work of art, history and literature, and the most complete legal compendium of Antiquity, dating back to earlier than the Biblical laws. Carried there by a prince from the neighboring country of Elam in Iran in the 12th century BC, the monument was exhibited on the Susa acropolis among other prestigious Mesopotamian masterpieces.

	A legal tradition

	This basalt stele was erected by King Hammurabi of Babylon (1792–1750 BC) probably at Sippar, city of the sun god Shamash, god of justice. Other monuments of this type belonging to a similar tradition were placed in the towns of his kingdom. Two Sumerian legal documents drawn up by Ur-Namma, king of Ur (c. 2100 BC) and Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c.1930 BC), precede the Law Code of Hammurabi. The Hammurabi Code—the most important legal compendium of the ancient Near East, drafted earlier than the Biblical laws—found its sources in these essays. The text, which occupies most of the stele, constitutes the raison d'être of the monument. The principal scene depicted shows the king receiving his investiture from Shamash. Remarkable for its legal content, this work is also an exceptional source of information about the society, religion, economy, and history of this period.

	The content of the Code

	The text is written in cuneiform script and the Akkadian language. It is divided into three parts:
	- a historical prologue relating the investiture of King Hammurabi in his role as ""protector of the weak and oppressed,"" and the formation of his empire and achievements;
	- a lyrical epilogue summing up his legal work and preparing its perpetuation in the future;
	- these two literary passages frame a text describing almost three hundred laws and legal decisions governing daily life in the kingdom of Babylon. The legal part of the text uses everyday language and is here simplified, for the king wanted it to be understood by all. However, the legal decisions are all constructed in the same manner: a phrase in the conditional sets out a problem of law or social order; it is followed by a response in the future tense, in the form of the sanction for the guilty party or the settlement of a situation: ""Should an individual do such and such a thing, such and such a thing will happen to him or her.""
	Grouped together in chapters, the issues addressed cover criminal and civil laws. The principal subjects are family law, slavery, and professional, commercial, agricultural and administrative law. Economic measures set prices and salaries. The longest chapter concerns the family, which formed the basis of Babylonian society. It deals with engagement, marriage and divorce, adultery and incest, children, adoption and inheritance, and the duties of children's nurses. Every aspect of each case is addressed, enabling the greatest number of observations to be made.

	The significance of the monument

	The Law Code of Hammurabi is valuable first and foremost as a model, being a treatise on the exercise of judiciary power in the context of Mesopotamian science, in which the particular never governs the general.
	The observation of several similar cases does not establish a general and universal principle, or law. It is not a code of laws in the sense that we understand it today, but rather a compendium of legal precedents. Contradictions and illogicalities (two similar cases causing different results) can be found in the Code, because it deals with particular judgements, from which the most personal elements (the names of the protagonists, for example) have been removed. Because justice was a royal prerogative in Mesopotamia, Hammurabi here sets out a selection of the wisest legal decisions that he had to take or ratify.
	This stele was, however, more than an educational tool. It was a code of the rules and prescriptions established by a sovereign authority, and therefore a code of laws. Not only does it contain a list of judicial rulings, but also a catalogue of the towns and territories annexed to the kingdom of Babylon. The stele of the Babylonian king Hammurabi constitutes a summary of one of the most prestigious reigns of ancient Mesopotamia. Executed in the last years of the sovereign's life, it was a political testament aimed at future princes, for whom it offered a model of wisdom and equity. The Code also served as a literary model for the schools of scribes, who were to copy it for over one thousand years.

This letter found at Ugarit is written in Akkadian. It is an edict by Tudhaliya IV, king of the Hittites, concerning horses used by messengers between the Egyptian and Hittite empires. The kingdom of Ugarit, within the Hittite sphere of influence, was responsible for enforcing this ruling. The authenticity of the letter is shown by the king's seal.
The international context
After the battle of Qadesh in the fourteenth century BC, a balance of power prevailed between the two great empires, Egyptian and Hittite, that shared the Near East. The kingdoms of the Levantine coast were divided between the empires' two zones of influence, the kingdom of Ugarit being a vassal of the Hittite empire.
A royal edict
This letter by king Tudhaliya IV of the Hittites is addressed to his vassal, the king of Ugarit. The small terracotta tablet bears a cuneiform text in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the Near East. It is not a simple letter but an edict promulgated by Tudhaliya IV. It establishes rules for the use of horses by messengers between Hatti (the homeland of the Hittites) and Egypt. It forbids Hittite messengers from taking Egyptian horses and, conversely, forbids Egyptian messengers from using Hittite horses. The king of Ugarit is to enforce this ruling as the messengers between the two empires have to pass through his small kingdom. 
The royal seal
The letter is shown to be authentic by the royal seal in the center of the tablet. The Hittite royal seal was circular, contrasting with the frequent use of cylindrical seals in Mesopotamia. In the center, beneath a hieroglyph of a winged sun, the symbol of Hittite royalty, are Hittite hieroglyphs giving the name of the king, flanked symmetrically by two other signs meaning ""Great King."" Cuneiform signs around the border of the seal give the king's title in two concentric registers: ""Seal of Tabarna Tudhaliya, Great King, king of Hatti.""

The mummy label is an emblematic funerary object from the Roman era in Egypt. Attached to the mummy, it was the deceased's identification and passport to eternity. A portrait of the deceased, with an epitaph in Greek, was depicted on one side, while a standard prayer formula in demotic script graced the other.
A Portrait of the Deceased
This exceptionally large label is rectangular in shape and slightly curved on the side. It has a hole in it, through which a linen tie was threaded to attach it to the mummy.The reverse side has a frontal view of the deceased, and the small curved side reproduces the upper rounded section of a stele. The deceased is wearing a red tunic adorned with two dark bands, and the sleeves are trimmed with a braid of the same color. She is wearing shoes on her splayed feet. Her thin neck supports an enormous head, which is disproportionately large for the body. Two immense eyes fill the triangular face; the thick eyebrows meet above the bridge of the broad nose, which joins the tiny mouth. Three bead pendants hang from her ears. Black lines arranged around her curly hair form a schematic design of an Osiris crown of justification. To the right of the deceased is an altar of horns for incense offerings. Below is an inscription in Greek: ""Artemis, daughter of Anaraus, whose mother is Tronchonminis, lived to the age of twenty-one years.""A Roman tabula-ansata-type label is drawn on the front side, while the unused space has been hatched with lines. This imitation label carries a formula in demotic script reading: ""May her soul live with Osiris Sokaris, the great god, master of the West, Tamin, daughter of Anarau, whose mother is Tronchonmin, dead in her twenty-first year. May her soul live forever.""

Keeping Identity after Death
The imagery on the reverse side was inspired by Ptolemaic funerary steles. Yet the deceased here, shown in a frontal pose, suggests the idea of renaissance and awakening. The importance given to the face, especially the oversized eyes, means that the preservation of the head, linked to that of the name, was of primordial concern, as they reflected her identity and her individuality.The simultaneous use of Greek and demotic script can be explained by the fact that Greek became the official language once the Ptolemaic kings took power. Yet the Egyptians continued to speak and write their own language, known as ""popular"" demotic, which developed in the late sixth century BC. It was to die out only in the early fifth century AD.The use of the wooden label as a means of identification dates from the New Kingdom. During the Roman period, the mummy label was well suited to the mass burials, density and stacking of bodies that characterized the funerary practices of the time.

A Label-Stele
This miniature portable stele was a less expensive replacement for the cumbersome stone monument. The short prayer formula was equally efficient and functioned as a Book for the Coming Forth by Day or the Second Book of Breathing. Given that the priority was to perpetuate the name of the deceased, the majority of the labels were written simply.This funerary object probably came from one of the necropolises situated on the western bank of the Nile in the region of Akhmim, formerly Panopolis, in Upper Egypt.

The invention of writing corresponded to the economical needs of a society at a time when the development of cities was giving rise to increasing number of exchanges and transactions. This form of writing was inscribed on a soft material, clay. The first tablets date from the Late Uruk period, in Mesopotamia, and the Proto-Elamite period in Iran. They often bear the mark of one or two cylinder seals, proof that an administrative check or an agreement between two parties had taken place.
A large tablet
This tablet is the largest from the Proto-Elamite period, corresponding to the earliest urban development in the late 4th millennium BC, in the Fars region (southwestern Iran), the present regional capital of which is Shiraz. It bears traces of three different types of administrative tools: writing, accounting and glyptics, a major art form of the period, corresponding to the use of seals. There are inscriptions of both writing and numeral signs on both sides of the tablet.
The emergence of a new writing system in the Fars region
Writing emerged in Iran nearly three centuries after being invented in southern Mesopotamia. This writing system, developed in the Fars region and called Proto-Elamite for this reason, is totally independent from the writing in use at Uruk. As no bilingual text exists that would enable us to establish an equivalence between the two systems, Proto-Elamite writing remains undecipherable. However, the reading direction (right to left) and its horizontality have been detected.
An accounting document sealed with images of animals in human poses
These Proto-Elamite tablets are accounting documents. Three different numerical systems are used on the tablet: a decimal system, a sexagesimal system and a mixed system known as SE. The various operations are listed on the front side of the tablet, recapitulated, with totals, on the back at the top. New figures appear: crescent-shaped notches and dots circled with a constellation of tiny points, some of which represent fractions. A pictographical sign resembling a fringed triangle, known as the ""hairy triangle,"" often appears, but its meaning remains unclear. A single seal was used on the document, a cylinder-seal that was rolled twice across the width of the tablet, covering most of the back of the tablet. The scene shows a bull symmetrically restraining two seated felines, alternating with a lion dominating two rearing bulls, each topped with a ""hairy triangle."" The animals stand on their hindlegs as if they were bipeds, a technique characteristic of the Proto-Elamite period in which animals were often depicted in a human pose. The choice of bulls and lions was deliberate, for these animals appear to personify cosmic forces, decisive in the balance of power in the world. In the scene, there is no durable winner or loser, but alternating, opposing forces that appear equal.

This long, slim, rectangular object is a scribe's palette made of ivory. It contains four brushes and still shows traces of use. There was an inscription on each side. The palette was the scribe's main tool and came to symbolize the profession. The present example was found in a New Kingdom tomb in the Theban necropolis, on 19 December 1861, by Count Michel Tyszkiewicz; it belonged to the important collection he donated to the Louvre in 1862.
Avant-garde ergonomics
The shape of this object is characteristic of the scribe's palettes that were used from the Fifth Dynasty through the late Pharaonic period: a long rectangle, usually made of wood (less frequently of ivory), with a slot to hold calami (reed-pens equivalent to our paintbrushes). There are two small oval wells at one end; the upper one still contains a cake of black ink, the lower one the remains of a cake of red. Colored stains all over the flat part of the palette indicate that the instrument was indeed used. The pen slot, which has a sliding cover, still contains four plant stems of which three are complete, their tips stained black and red. Hieratic inscriptions (in cursive script) were painted in black on both surfaces of the palette, but these have almost worn away and are now illegible. This practical, easy-to-hold instrument combines a palette for mixing colors with a pen box and ink pots; it could even be used as a ruler.
The scribe's equipment
To do his job properly, the scribe needed several other instruments in addition to his palette and calami. He used a mortar and pestle to grind pigments (stored in a little bag) into powder, adding acacia gum as a binder to form little cakes of color. He used a paper knife and smoother to make the surface of his papyrus sheet presentable and suitable for writing on. He then took his calamus, flattened one of its tips, dipped it into a pot of water, and wiped it over the paint, as we still do with gouache. The scribe had a range of writing surfaces at his disposal: papyrus, wooden tablets, fragments of pottery or limestone (ostraca), fabric, etc. He used two main colors: black (made from charcoal) for the text, and red ocher (from iron oxides) for the titles, chapter headings, and corrections. Once his work was done, he affixed his seal to the document. All this equipment was stored in wooden boxes which often feature next to scribes on bas-reliefs and paintings. Painters also used palettes which had several wells for different colors.
The emblem of a prestigious profession
This essential instrument, which might seem rather basic, soon became the emblem of the scribe's profession. Its image was used to denote the word ""scribe"" and the various other terms relating to the act of writing. Administration played an important role in Egypt, where these specialists were held in high esteem; whoever wanted to make a good living and be his own master was encouraged to take up the profession. Scribes were present whenever and wherever accounts, inventories, or inspections were needed. Many palettes - including artificial ones such as those carved out of stone - have been found in tombs.

This type of rectangular wooden tablet was used by student scribes. The black text, with punctuation and dates in red, is written in hieratic script. It comes from The Satire of the Trades, which praises the position of the scribe by encouraging the student to select this job, mentioning the fatigue, the dirt, and the risks of all the other trades. This satire was one of the great classical texts for Egyptian students.

Beautiful handwriting
This tablet is incomplete; it was originally a rectangular plank of wood that had been stuccoed, covered with canvas, and once again coated with smooth, impermeable stucco. This final coat allowed students to reuse the surface several times. A cord for hanging the tablet could be inserted in the hole in the upper right-hand corner, where the inscription begins. The text is written in black ink, from right to left, in cursive hieratic script on both sides. Punctuation and the added dates are written in red. Exercises were often dated in the scribe schools; in this, apprentice scribes in ancient Agype were no different from students today. These dates correspond to 18 writing sessions, in this case, two lines copied per session. Students learned hieratic writing by dictation and by copying literary texts. Given the quality of the writing, it is hard to determine if this tablet was written by an excellent student or was a model prepared by a copyist for his students. 
The Satire of the Trades
The passages, from The Instructions of Khety, son of Duauf, now known by its modern title, The Satire of the Trades, first discusses Meskhenet, the goddess of birth: she predicts a literary profession for the child. After a short excerpt from the Hymn to the Nile, the series of the various trades follows, with a commentary about the drawbacks of each one.""...The matt-weaver in the workshop, he is worse off than a woman; with his knees in his chest, he cannot breathe. If he loses a day of weaving, he is beaten 50 strokes; he bribes the doorkeeper to let him see the light of day...""The caravan-driver goes abroad after leaving his goods to his children, fearful of lions and Asiatics... He reaches home exhausted; the trip has worn him out. Whether his home is made of fabric or bricks, his return is joyless...""This discouraging description ends with praise for the scribe's trade, describing the indisputable superiority of this profession ""... he is the boss. If you know writing, it will be more useful to you than [all] those other professions I've set before you. Behold!...""

An anthology
The text was first written during the Middle Kingdom. Yet the preparation of the support and the paleography date the tablet to the 18th Dynasty, making this the oldest known copy of this text ever found. It is unfortunate that so much of it is missing. Yet it indicates that this Satire of the Trades was part of the Egyptian literary tradition and was used in schools during the New Kingdom and even later, according to other examples. Aside from the excellent quality of the calligraphy, this work was also a model of style (the language is classical), and text analysis, and was even a moral lesson for the student who also had to learn the text by heart.

This small group shows a high-ranking scribe at work, reading an unrolled papyrus. He is under the protection of the god Thoth, patron of the scribes, represented in his animal form as a baboon. The inscriptions identify him as Nebmerutef, known to have been an important figure at the time of Amenophis III. The piece is a good example of the mannered style characteristic of his reign.
Description
A high official is portrayed in the attitude of a scribe, under the attentive gaze of the god Thoth, patron of writing. He is engrossed in reading a document, seated cross-legged on the ground, with his torso leaning slightly forward, and his right hand resting on the papyrus. He wears a short-sleeved shirt, which falls down over a loincloth knotted at the waist. In accordance with the fashion of the time, his delicately carved curls can be seen beneath the radiating tresses of the wig. Above him, the baboon sacred to Thoth is seated on a pedestal; the damaged muzzle emerges from a broad ruff, while the upper part of the body is covered in thick fur. Between the scribe and the baboon-god stands an offering table.
Identification
Inscriptions identify the figures and indicate their relationship. Nebmerutef was at the same time chancellor, royal scribe and high priest. He asks the baboon that he might benefit from the food deposited in the sacred precinct to nourish his own body. The purpose of this small stone sculpture was to give perpetual, timeless form to his request for food.Nebmerutef was a high official in the reign of Amenophis III. As such, he enjoyed very special royal favor in being allowed to deposit his statue in the god's own temple - probably at Hermopolis, the most important sanctuary of Thoth. God of knowledge, science and wisdom, he was the patron of scholars and high administrative officials, who drew inspiration from him. It is something new for a courtier to foster a personal relationship between himself and the god, by having himself portrayed alongside Thoth.
Royal Generosity
Nebmerutef is also depicted on a wall of the temple of Amenophis III at Soleb. Close to the king, he is shown taking part in the jubilee celebrations, alongside the greatest figures of the realm. The graywacke stone, selected for its color and the fine grain that allowed great precision in carving, is a noble material. Sculpted in the royal workshops, this ""portrait"" of the scribe is modeled on portraits of the king, as the only possible source of reference: the narrow, almond-shaped eyes, accentuated by a cosmetic line that extends as far as the temples, and the youthful air of the face, are all features taken from statues of Amenophis III himself.Thanks to the king's generosity, Nebmerutef was also able to have himself portrayed in a second sculpture, similar in composition, carved in costly white alabaster. Today these stand side by side in the same display-case.

Almost everyone has seen this image of the Seated Scribe. Located on the upper floor of the Department of Egyptian Antiquities, this is the most famous of unknown figures. We know nothing about the person portrayed: neither his name, nor title, nor even the exact period during which he lived. Nevertheless, this statue never fails to impress visitors discovering it for the first time.
A specific posture
The Louvre's scribe, known as the ""Seated Scribe"", is indeed sitting cross-legged, his right leg crossed in front of his left. The white kilt, stretched over his knees, serves as a support. He is holding a partially rolled papyrus scroll in his left hand. His right hand must have held a brush, now missing. The most striking aspect of this sculpture is the face, particularly the elaborately inlaid eyes: they consist of a piece of red-veined white magnesite, in which a piece of slightly truncated rock crystal was placed. The front part of the crystal was carefully polished. The back side was covered with a layer of organic material, creating the color of the iris and also probably serving as an adhesive. The entire eye was then held in the socket by two large copper clips welded on the back. A line of black paint defines the eyebrows. The hands, fingers, and fingernails are sculpted with a remarkable delicacy. His chest is broad and the nipples are marked by two wooden dowels. The statue was cleaned in 1998, although the process merely reduced the wax overpainting. This restoration brought out the well-conserved ancient polychromy.
An unknown figure
The semicircular base on which the figure sits must have originally fit into a larger base that carried his name and titles, such as the base for the statue of Prince Setka, exhibited in room 22 of the Louvre. This base is missing, and the context of the discovery does not provide any additional information. According to the archeologist Auguste Mariette, who found the work, the statue of the scribe was apparently discovered in Saqqara on 19 November 1850, to the north of the Serapeum's line of sphinxes. But the precise location is not known; unfortunately, the documents concerning these excavations were published posthumously, the excavation journals had been lost, and the archives were scattered between France and Egypt. Furthermore, the site had been pillaged and ransacked, and no information concerning the figure's identity could be provided. Some historians have tried to link it to one of the owners of the statues discovered at the same time. The most convincing of these associates the scribe to Pehernefer. Certain stylistic criteria, such as the thin lips, which was unusual, the form of the torso, and the broad chest could support this theory. The statue of Pehernefer dates from the 4th Dynasty. This is an additional argument in favor of an earlier dating for this statue, which has sometimes been dated to the 6th Dynasty. Another argument supporting this date is that ""writing"" scribes were mostly created in the 4th and early 5th Dynasties; after this period, most scribes were portrayed in ""reading"" poses.
A scribe at work
The scribe is portrayed at work, which is unusual in Egyptian statuary. Although no king was ever portrayed in this pose, it seems that it was originally used for members of the royal family, such as the king's sons or grandsons, as was the case for the sons of Didufri (4th Dynasty), who were represented in this position.

Queen Marie Antoinette purchased the château de Saint-Cloud from the Duke of Orléans in 1785 and furnished it to suit her own taste. This table was in the queen's inner chamber. It was crafted by the cabinetmaker Adam Weisweiler and delivered by the merchant Daguerre, who probably had a hand in the design. The piece is characteristic of Weisweiler's work and of the refinement of the Louis XVI style.
A writing table
This lacquered, ebony-veneered, oblong table has an apron furnished with drawers. The front of the apron is divided into three sections, with the center projecting slightly. The middle and left sections comprise a single large drawer with a hinged flap covered in blue (originally green velvet) that, when raised, reveals the actual drawer. The small right section of the apron is made up of a drawer (which lacks its writing case), containing a gilt copper inkwell, a powder case, and a sponge box. The central section has a rack and pinion on the back, enabling it to be raised like a sloping desktop. When closed, the table seems to become purely decorative.
Lacquer and marquetry
Cabinetwork plays only a small part in the appearance of the table, most of which is veneered wtih Japan lacquer panels encircled with aventurine and set off by gilt-bronze beading. The apron also features materials not commonly used in cabinetmaking, especially steel, which here makes one of its earliest appearances in a piece of furniture. Inside the table, Weisweiler's skill at marquetry becomes apparent: the bottoms and sides of the drawers are inlaid with sycamore diamonds edged with three narrow bands of white, green, and black, and punctuated at the top by four ebony disks. Similar marquetry can be found on the card table made for Marie-Antoinette by Jean Henri Riesener, likewise for the château de Saint-Cloud, and now in the Musée Nissim de Camondo in Paris. With its stretcher composed of cleverly intertwining rods supporting a gilt-bronze openwork basket in the middle, the table is typical of Adam Weisweiller's work.
Lavish and finely executed gilt mounts
The writing table features gilt-bronze decoration, perhaps made by the gilder François Remond whose services Daguerre often called upon. The feet, which are cased, are decorated with canephores enfolded in classical drapery, a motif that recurs throughout Weisweiler's work. The apron is made of polished steel plates highlighted with gilt bronze friezes. The projecting front section is decorated with a mask of Apollo flanked by a pair of winged sphinxes, and by foliated scrolls. The sides feature garlands of flowers and fruits held up by ribbons tied in bows. The delicate chasing and the polychrome effect of the different materials make this table a masterpiece, crafted under the orchestration of Daguerre.

An exaleiptron was a recipient used by women for their toilette, especially to hold perfumed unguents. The principal scene shows - probably for the first time in Attica - the birth of Athena, with the young goddess emerging from her father Zeus's head. This vessel is typical of the second quarter of the sixth century BCE, when Athenian art freed itself from Corinthian influence to focus on the representation of mythological scenes, and hence on the depiction of the human figure.
A container for unguents
This kind of vessel was used by women for their toilette. Its name derives from the Greek word meaning ""to anoint,"" and it was used to hold unguents and other perfumed oils. The distinctive form of the central cup-shaped receptacle, with its inward-turned lip, was designed to prevent spillages. The flattened rim is decorated with a miniature frieze depicting duelliing hoplites. The ""legs,"" however, are decorated with three more sizeable paintings, the principal scene showing the birth of Athena, a very popular subject. The two other sides show the judgement of Paris (the shepherd attempting to make his escape as Hermes brings the three goddesses to him, while Peitho or Persuasion tries to hold him back) and a marriage procession. This last image suggests that the exaleiptron may have been a wedding gift.
The birth of Athena
An oracle had told Zeus that he would be dethroned by the son that he would have with Metis, his first wife. To avoid this fate he swallowed Metis, who was already pregnant with their daughter. Later, when he complained  of terrible headaches,  Hephaistos split open his head with an ax. Thus was born Athena, springing from Zeus's head fully clad in armor.The decorative scheme adopted here is entirely traditional. Zeus sits enthroned in the middle, lightning bolt and scepter in hand, while Athena, springing from his head, is welcomed by six divinities. Flanking Zeus are the Eileithyai, twin goddesses who presided over childbirth; also present are Hephaistos, the blacksmith god with his double-headed ax, and Poseidon with his trident. At the sides are two goddesses less easy to identify: if we assume that each is associated with her male neighbor, then the figure on the left would be Aphrodite, and the one on the right Amphitrite.
The C Painter: an Attic artist
This exaleiptron is attributed to the C Painter, so called for his Corinthian-inspired style, visible here in the miniature hoplite frieze which recalls Proto-Corinthian work. The rest, however, is purely Attic in the monumentality of both the figures and the composition.Painter C was active in the second quarter of the sixth century BCE, a time when Athenian art was freeing itself from Corinthian influence and developing its own - mythological - repertoire. This would therefore be one of the very earliest Attic images of the birth of Athena.

Cosmetic flasks became so common in the trans-Elamite world in the late 3rd millennium BC that hundreds of them have survived. They were made of chlorite or arsenical copper, and the metal flasks were often shaped into animals. The study of the contents of these small items is in progress. 
Flask-statuettes
The most elaborate metal cosmetic flasks are shaped into complete animals that look like statuettes. Only the tubular bottle neck with its flared rim on the animal's back makes it clear that it was a container. The craftsmen showed a fondness for herbivores: rams, mouflons, camels, or bulls. Monkeys and snakes were also produced but are much rarer. Until quite recently, anthropomorphic vases seemed exceptional.Note that on the few bull-shaped flasks found, the animal is almost always depicted in the same way: wearing a collar, which suggests it was a domestic animal, with a heavy dewlap and a long tail almost always attached to the right leg for some obscure reason.These flask-statuettes are not completely hollow because the part used as a container was often quite small, as is the case with this bull.
The circulation of cosmetics in the Near East in the late 3rd millennium BC
Containers for cosmetic powders, ointments, and perhaps perfumes became very common in the trans-Elamite world and the Oxus civilization in the late 3rd millennium BC. Hundreds of specimens have survived. They are small because they were used for rare, precious products. Flasks made of chlorite,  a soft green stone that was easy to work, are often square at the base with a quadrangular body and narrow neck, no doubt to protect the contents. The arsenical copper or silver flasks look like small bottles or take the shape of various animals. Whether they were made of chlorite or metal, the flasks seem to have contained the same products: dark powder for eye makeup and white lead powder for whitening the skin. These products were used by both men and women, because bottles and flasks have been found in male and female graves. A bulb-topped pin used to spread the cosmetic product was often found with the flasks, but not with this one.

Despite its many missing teeth, this comb has retained its full value by virtue of its central scene, still virtually intact. It features three figures, with a Greek inscription above and below, together depicting a dance or poetry competition.
A comb of great antiquity
This comb is carved from elephant ivory. Two rows of teeth flank the central rectangle: an extremely fine-toothed comb in the upper half, with larger and more widely spaced teeth in the lower half. Many teeth are missing in both parts, particularly the lower one. Some have been glued back in place.
The enigmatic figures of the decorative scene
A Greek inscription runs along the upper and lower sections of the central spine, following incised lines in the decoration. In the center are three figures, rendered in an open-work design that emphasizes the sculpted appearance of the object as a whole. The central figure is a woman dressed in a long robe with braids and medallions and wearing a headband. She is depicted in front of an architectural structure consisting of an arch resting on two cabled columns. She wears a shoulder strap and in her raised right hand seems to be holding a crown, the upper part of which forms part of the border. To the right, another woman stands in the same pose, but without the shoulder strap or the crown. To the left, a man dressed in a tunic is shown either picking up or setting down a scroll placed on a small stool in front of him. He seems to be making a sign of greeting to the central figure with his left hand. Note that only his right foot has a sandal with straps, while his left foot is bare - perhaps an oversight on the part of the artist.
An invocation to fortune
The composition of the scene suggests that the central figure is the principal subject, and that the figures flanking her are paying tribute to her in one form or another. This is confirmed by the Greek inscription: ""Long live Helladia's fortune and the Blues! Amen!"" This invocation to fortune and to the Blues indicates that the object relates to a literary competition, or else to a mime or pantomime performance. An actress named Helladia is therefore probably the central figure on the comb. Having won the competition, she probably had the Greek inscription added to immortalize this important event in her life. In general, ivories such as this one, depicting victories in competitions, date from the 5th or 6th centuries.

Is there anyone who has not seen one of these pretty, carved wooden figurines in an art book? They are called ""the swimmer spoons,"" as some of them are holding a duck with hinged wings that open to reveal a spoon. This charming work - one of the most famous in the Egyptian department - has far more meaning than first meets the eye.
A Swimmer
With her slender body in a horizontal pose, a nude young woman, wearing only a necklace and belt, holds a bowl in her outstretched arms. The body is carved in a straight line, while the neck and head are sculpted from a separate piece of wood and are placed upright, at right angles to the body, in a fairly unnatural pose. On closer observation, we can see that the head is not placed between the two arms at the top of the shoulders, but is behind and atop the back. When viewed from the front, it is aligned along the same plane as the bowl, along with her necklace, which also forms a base for the head. The head is moreover slightly too large for her body. Her hair, eyes, and necklace are outlined in black paint. 
A Strange Body
These strange details, however, are not visible immediately, and the first impression is one of an extremely charming female figure. This is because the anatomical distortions created by the artist were calculated and deliberate. The work is designed from two distinct points of view: on the one hand, the body is swimming horizontally; and on the other, the bust, the head, and the bowl can be viewed from the front. A larger scale was used for these latter elements. Egyptians composed their statues and drawings by incorporating several different points of view in a single work. They were not interested in a faithful reproduction of reality. The most important aspect was the message: the meaning projected by the creations.
A Lucky Charm
This small sculpture has a twofold meaning. On the one hand, a young female figure is a universal symbol of love and hence the promise of continued life. On the other, the depiction of the bowl as an Egyptian ""cartouche"" - an elongated form framed by a highly stylized loop of rope - is significant. The rope usually surrounds the name of the king like a lasso, symbolizing the space encompassed by his power. Here, it encircles the spoon with its engraved decor of three Tilapia fish, also called Nile carp, which are nibbling at water-lily stems. This fish incubates its fertilized eggs in its mouth; for the Egyptians, it was a symbol of sexuality and regeneration. This object was therefore imbued with the positive virtues of the magical images, and would have provided good luck and fortune to its owner, whether male or female. Although this type of object is called a ""cosmetic spoon,"" its actual use is uncertain. It has no trace of color, nor does it show any sign of use. It is fragile, delicate, and esthetic. It may have been both an art object and a lucky charm - an auspicious talisman meant to enhance the owner's sexual life and his or her life in general.

The goddess Diana rests after the hunt, assisted in her ritual toilet by a nymph. Under the veneer of the mythological subject matter, this painting is a hymn to the female body. The refined drawing, glowing skin, gentle touch, and luminous palette attest to the artist's maturity.
Back in favor
This female nude, painted in 1742, was purchased by the Louvre in 1852. It was the first Boucher painting to enter the Louvre since the early 19th century, thus marking the end of a long period when the artist's work, which the revolutionaries judged too frivolous, was out of favor. Exhibited in the Salon of 1742, Diana Leaving Her Bath belongs to a series of small paintings destined for collectors' cabinets.
A very sensual Diana
Diana frequently depicted in 18th-century French painting. In the hands of François Boucher, the huntress abandons her willful character. One can recognize the goddess by her standard attributes: the golden crescent she wears in her hair in reference to her connection with the moon, as well as the bow and recently felled game lying next to her. But most prominent here are the traits in fashion under the reign of Louis XV: the milky complexion, small full face, and curvaceous figure. Her virginal state distances her from any ill intent; she reveals her nudity with total frankness and lack of prudery, like a novice to the world of romance.
An exaltation of the female nude
Boucher is above all interested in the relationship between the body and nature. The intense blue of the drapery is offset by the rosy freshness of skin and the subtle green of the landscape. The treatment of the female nude is particularly delicate here; the modeling of the body is very sensual, as it is constructed entirely of light emanating from the left of the painting.

The biblical subject is a pretext for the evocation of a colorfully mythicized Orient. The sinuousness of the body recalls Ingres, but this generous, sensual nude is characteristic of the female type invented by Chassériau. 
Subject as pretext
The biblical theme serves not as matter for a religious painting, but as a pretext for a variation on the Oriental odalisque. Esther is a woman of the East, one of those creatures, all curves and arabesques, imagined by Ingres, whose pupil Chassériau was. And indeed the picture, exuding sensuality and the love of fluid feminine contours, is reminiscent of Ingres and his odalisques. Yet if Esther is rendered as an Oriental, this is not the case of the sky, the background or the two figures flanking her. The fabrics, jewelry and chromatic harmony that enhance Esther's dazzling body testify to Chassériau's admiration for Delacroix. 
Esther
The Book of Esther tells the story of a young Jewish woman who, deported to Babylon, becomes queen of the Persians and saves the captive Jews from massacre. However, the narrative also echoes Oriental tales recounting the taming of a tyrant by a beautiful slave girl.  
History of the painting
Hung at the Salon in 1842, this painting remained in the artist's family until being bequeathed to the Louvre in 1934 by one of his distant descendents, Baron Arthur Chassériau.

In the fourth and fifth centuries AD, craftsmen in the Near East excelled in the making of kohl flacons in pottery, wood, reed, or glass - as here -using the blowing technique. Thin streaks of glass were applied to the container in spirals and zigzags. With one or more compartments, these recipients were sometimes accompanied by small bronze, ivory, or glass wands to apply makeup to the eyes.
Near Eastern, fourth or fifth century AD
Although the place in which it was made cannot be determined precisely, this clear glass flacon was probably produced in the Near East in the fourth or fifth century AD. It was either made in a workshop in Syria, where it was found, or in Palestine, then an important center for the production and distribution of glassware. With its two tubular compartments, this small recipient is a toiletry item that was particularly widespread in the eastern Roman Empire and produced in large quantities until the Islamic period.
A kohl flacon
It was made to hold kohl, a dark powder used by women - and also by men - as eye makeup and for the medicinal properties of the lead sulfide it contained. Kohl was used as medicine in antiquity. It was used for its astringent properties to treat eye inflammations and infections caused by insects, which were common afflictions in Egypt and the Near East. Kohl flacons were made using a great variety of materials such as pottery, wood, and reed. The Palestinians had a taste for glass containers of this kind. The recipients have from one to four compartments and are generally accompanied by a small bronze, glass, or ivory wand that was used to apply kohl to the eyelids and eyelashes.
Glassblowing technique
The flacon was made using blowing and a shaping technique developed circa 50 BC by glassmakers in the eastern Mediterranean region. The technique is still used today. It consists of picking up a small blob of molten glass, the gob, on the end of a blowing iron about a meter long, blowing into the tube to make a bubble of glass and then rolling it on a slab called a marver to shape it as required using various tools. The decoration was applied after a period of slow cooling; thin dribbles of glass were applied to the neck and belly of the container, forming zigzags and spirals.

This small sculptural flask is one of a great number of glass birds produced in northern Italy during the first century AD. It was made by blowing glass, a technique discovered by Romans at the eastern reaches of the empire circa 50 BC. These bird flasks were toiletry containers and have been found all over the Mediterranean area. They contained cosmetics in powder form, access to which was gained by breaking the end of the bird's tail.
A toiletry container
This bird-shaped flask in transparent, slightly bluish glass is one of a great number of small naturalistic containers designed to contain cosmetics in powder form, access to which was gained by breaking the end of the bird's tail, rather like a modern ampoule; there is no other opening in the flask. Traces of white powder are still visible inside the bird's body. Most of these containers were discovered in tombs, where their contents may have been used to prepare the body of the deceased before burial. However, it seems that these birds were not designed specifically for funerary rites, but mainly as everyday toiletry containers. Examples of these birds, for example, were found in the baths at Herculaneum in southern Italy.
Glassblowing technique
This powder container was made by glassblowing, a technique that was perfected circa 50 BC by Roman glassworkers in the eastern Mediterranean region. The technique is identical to that used today. It consists of gathering a small quantity of glass (the gob) at the end of a metal pipe about one meter in length (the blowing iron) and then blowing down the pipe so that the gob of glass inflates. The gob is then rolled on a flat surface (the marver) and worked with various tools to obtain the desired shape. Cosmetics were inserted into the vessel in powder form when it was finished; the glassworker would then seal the container while it was still hot.
Production of glass birds
Production of these small glass birds was particularly abundant during the reign of Emperor Augustus (27 BC-AD 14) and was still quite popular until circa AD 70. Although many such birds have been found in Greece, Cyprus, and Syria, northern Italy (particularly Piedmont) and the canton of Ticino in modern Switzerland seem to have been the principal region for the production and distribution of this type of container.

This little kohl pot in the form of a servant is an excellent example of the taste of the refined society that developed in the New Kingdom. Wealthy people took great care over their toilet. They also enjoyed surrounding themselves with elegant objects and reminders of their own privileges.

	A pot and a statuette

	This statuette is in fact a functional object: the figure carries what would for him be an enormous jar, but is in reality a small cosmetics pot, of an ideal size for the user. Vessels of this type were made in large sizes, in calcite or terracotta, and also in small sizes, in stone or glass. The porter is carved from a single block of limestone and stands on a base of calcite, reflecting the Egyptians' fondness for combining materials. The knotted loincloth between his thighs had an inlaid part at the front falling from the waist, which is now lost, as is the earring.

	A society of masters and servants

	The 18th Dynasty saw an increase in domestic comforts and a growing taste for luxury. The wealthy embellished their homes with elegant utilitarian objects, including cosmetic pots, which had always been an important part of Egyptian life. The miniature jar the figure carries still contains traces of black powder, the kohl which the Egyptians used so much.
	The porter's hair and the stereotypical facial features indicate that he is Nubian. Many of the domestics servants in the service of wealthy Egyptians in the New Kingdom were Nubians, whose country was by then completely colonized. He also has the short legs of a dwarf, and a hunchback, deformities often found in representations of domestics. It is possible that dwarves were especially sought after as members of the household for reasons of superstition.

	Movement in Egyptian art

	The vertical axis of the body passes between the feet and through the navel to terminate at the figure's right ear: the torso is thus thrust to the right, to compensate for the weight of the pot, which is entirely borne on the left shoulder. The face is turned a little to the left. Seen in profile, the body leans forward slightly to balance the load borne on the back of the shoulder. The man seems to be walking with difficulty, as if weighed down by his burden.
	The frontal emphasis characteristic of Egyptian representations of the human body has here been abandoned in order to render effort through complexity of movement. The piece is intended to be seen from all sides, rather than from the four traditional points of view (front, back, right profile and left profile), and only the square base gives any indication of orientation.
	The reason for this liberty taken with convention is simple: there was no intention of representing a particular, identifiable person here, but rather a genre subject, a servant at work. The look of eternal composure that was sought for in the portraits of notables, kings, and gods here gives way to the expression of physical effort, demonstrating that the Egyptians knew perfectly well how to portray the body in motion.

The figurine has lost its feet and plinth, which have now been replaced by a modern base. The earrings and the pivoting top of this kohl recipient are also missing. These objects were often made in the form of the god Bes, who protected the valuable contents. The palette of bright colors that sparkle against the white background is especially remarkable in that it was created with metal oxides.
A Product of the Ceramic Arts
Egyptians produced a never-ending array of amulets and figurines from siliceous clay decorated with a surface glaze for more than three thousand years. The basic technique remained unchanged: an object was fashioned by sculpting or casting clay consisting of silica - desert sand or crushed quartz - some calcium, and an alkaline material, generally vegetal ashes (potassium), along with an unidentified organic binder. It was left to dry in the open air, during which the alkaline salts moved to the surface (through efflorescence). The object was then fired in a kiln at around 850  C, which melted the silica on the surface, creating a shiny glaze. The partial vitrification at the core of the object created cohesion between the particles. Throughout these three thousand years, the Egyptians never produced lead glazes on clay, as opposed to the Mesopotamians, for example.
A Masterful Use of White and Colors
Another method for creating a beautiful, brilliant glaze consisted in plunging the object into an enamel emulsion made up of water, a colored mineral powder, and an alkaline. The surface was then entirely vitrified; in all likelihood, this was the method used for this object. The so-called ""efflorescence"" method leaves pits where there is less exchange with the air; there is therefore less enamel at these spots. To obtain the whitest possible surface, the clay had to consist of pure quartz without any coloring agents such as iron oxide, which is found in desert sand. New brilliant colors atop this white were introduced in the Eighteenth Dynasty: these included a dark cobalt blue and a bright red created from iron oxide.
The Painted Decor
An in-depth examination reveals that the entire motif was probably painted using some type of brush dipped in emulsions that contained powdered metal oxides. The blue color highlights the incised lines and the god's jewelry and hair. The tongue, navel, and nipples are red; a green wash covers the front of the ears, while a yellow wash shades the eyes. The details on the eyes, mouth, and animal-skin breeches (complete with tail) are painted in manganese brown, a color used in Egyptian faience from a very early era.It is difficult to add color using oxide paints, as the colored areas tend to bleed at the edges - hence the invention of incised colored lines. This creates a perfect result when the technique is mastered, as was the case in the workshops of Kings Amenophis III and Amenophis IV. The quality of the colors on this object is remarkable, due to an excellent knowledge of metal oxides.

The mirror was purchased by Louis XIV in 1684 from the dealer Le Brun at the same time as the sconce MR 251. It comprises several pieces of sard and cameos. The stones are set off by a metalwork mount in the style of Pierre Delabarre, a 17th-century goldsmith. This work reflects the interest of 17th-century collectors in hard stone and the richness of Louis XIV's collection of precious and semiprecious stones.
Cameos and sard to frame a mirror
The rectangular rock-crystal mirror is set in a frame decorated with pieces of sard, probably reused stones. The shape of the frame is evocative of a window recess or frame. It comprises a discontinuous arched pediment supported by two small columns, and a base. The two molded elements forming the pediment may have come from ancient vases; the gray agate columns were possibly produced as part of the decoration of a cabinet; and the two small vases at the top corners were probably carved from reused agate eggs. The cameos date from the Renaissance. The agate cameos on the frieze depict the twelve Caesars facing each other two by two; the cameo at the center of the base shows Diana's head in profile; and the cameo in the center of the pediment represents a woman's head, also in profile. At the foot of the columns set against a metal strip are two busts in garnet that are similar to a garnet and gold bust of a warrior kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. 
A mount in enameled gold and precious stones
The mount has the same characteristics as the sconce MR 251. It features small openwork leaves and enameled gold seeds. The enamel is both opaque (white, light green, light blue, mauve) and translucent (dark blue, green, orange, red, black). The enamel decoration is located at the base and runs around the mirror itself and the precious stones. The pea-pod motif -common in goldwork in the first half of the 17th century - is also present, especially on either side of the Diana cameo. The capitals and the bases of the columns also feature painted white enamel decorated with polychrome palmettes and seeds. The decoration is similar to that surrounding the base of the ewer MR 445.
A mount in the style of Delabarre
Collectors of hard stones liked to enhance them with metalwork mounts. Two styles of mount were favored in 17th-century France: the ""Delabarre"" style, after the goldsmith Pierre Delabarre, and a more classical style. The mirror in the Louvre is representative of the ""Delabarre"" style. At the time, there existed collections of model bouquets made up of small cutout leaves with trefoil, pointed, or rounded shapes, often hollowed out. Inside the bouquets were strings of seeds and pea pods. One of the ornamentalists who created such bouquets was Pierre Delabarre, who was appointed master goldsmith in Paris in 1625 and granted lodgings at the Louvre. The bouquets were reworked in precious metals by goldsmiths. The pieces of sard and the cameos are assembled on gilded brass plaques and joined up with small enameled gold leaves in the style of Delabarre - some of them hollowed out - in opaque or translucent enamel. This mount is also dotted with white seeds. This decoration is very similar to that of the sconce purchased by Louis XIV at the same time.

This red wool sprang cap was used to hold the hair of a woman of Antinoe after death. Discovered during excavations in 1897 led by Albert Gayet, tomb C 350 in the Byzantine necropolis of Antinoe contained the body of a woman dubbed the Amazon or the Horsewoman, because of the leather saddle found at her side. This ""athletic"" element aside, the tomb contained the components of a highly feminine wardrobe, including a headband, hair curlers, dresses and so on.
Wardrobe elements
This type of headdress - a legacy of the Greek fashion that can be seen on certain female figures painted on various fourth-century BC vases - seems to have been very popular among Coptic women. Nearly five hundred sprang caps of this type have been discovered in tombs. A few were found in situ, on the heads of the deceased, so putting an end to the debate concerning the purpose of these nets, which until this point had been believed to be knitted reticules. Three sprang caps comparable with this example were unearthed in the tomb of Colluthus, situated in one of the necropolises of Antinoe. The furnishings in this tomb also included papyri dating from the mid-fifth century, so providing a date for this type of item.
Sprang technique
This weaving technique is known to have been practised in Denmark from the Bronze Age, which explains the Scandinavian roots of the term ""sprang."" The technique consisted of intertwining the warp threads, which were stretched and attached at both ends to a loom or frame, to create a rectangular piece of fabric. The two long sides were then sewn together to form a tube, and one of the ends was knotted with a drawstring that formed a knot at the top. The piece of fabric might also be folded in half to form a bag, which explains the confusion concerning their use. Small lyre-shaped looms or rectangular frames were used for this type of weaving. Images of gynaeceum scenes on Greek vases depict women holding these looms, confirming that sprang weaving was women's work.

The empress Josephine only owned this cabinet, which served as a jewelry case, for a short period of time. It was delivered to her in 1809, just before her divorce from Napoleon, and subsequently belonged to the empress Marie-Louise, the emperor's second wife. The cabinet is made of yew and purpleheart, with inlaid mother of pearl and gilt bronze. Three doors open onto the main body of the piece, which holds the drawers where the jewelry was kept.

Furniture for Josephine
This jewelry cabinet was intended for the bedchamber of the empress Joséphine (1763–1814) in the Palais des Tuileries. The bronzes conceal locks and mechanisms allowing access to the drawers and secret compartments. The secret mechanisms were changed when the cabinet was given to the empress Marie-Louise (1791–1847) in 1810. In 1812, the jewelry case was supplemented by two further pieces from the cabinetmaker François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter, which were smaller but in the same style.
A cabinet of architectural shape
Designed after a model by the architect Charles Percier (1764–1838), the cabinet has the shape of a building standing on eight vertical legs and suppported by a rectangular base. Above the cornice rises a stylobate. A cassolette for perfumes stands on the base. The legs and cornice are made of purpleheart, while the interior of the cabinet, furnished with thirty drawers of the same wood (ten in each part of the body), are neither of purpleheart nor yew, but solid mahogany.
Lavish gilt bronze decoration
The jewelry case is lavishly decorated with elements in bronze. In the center is a scene depicting the birth of the Queen of the Earth, ""to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten to bear their offerings."" Long attributed to Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843), the bronzes were probably made by the Maison Jacob-Desmalter. The model for the subject in the center was the work of the sculptor Antoine-Denis Chaudet (1763–1810), whose drawings are in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Louvre. Lastly, on each of the side doors stands a goddess turning toward the central scene. The decoration as a whole foreshadows the ornamental excess of the late nineteenth century.

293,Beauty,"Toilet mirror with the cypher of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of King James II of England",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/toilet-mirror?selection=44868,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-miroir-toilette-chiffre-d039anne.jpg?1527828012,"
The fashion for toilet services probably appeared during first half of the seventeenth century in the court of France, whence it spread to Europe, and especially England. The mirror of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York (1637-1671), conserved in the Louvre, is a major expression of seventeenth-century goldsmithing. Adorned with very realistic floral decoration, this work by an unknown goldsmith reveals the rise of an ornamental exuberance at the time of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria.
A highly refined work in gold
This rectangular mirror is made of gilt silver decoration applied over a mahogany core. The frame comprises eight identical sections with a floral border, covered with a decoration of repoussé and chased flowers and foliage on a matte ground. The junction of these eight elements is hidden, at the corners of the frame by Anne Hyde's soldered cipher and in the middle on the sides by a large floret. The frame is surmounted by an arched pediment made up of three assembled elements. It is decorated with symmetrical scrolling foliage on a matte ground, laid out on either side of Anne Hyde's cipher, which is crowned and encircled by a laurel wreath. The detail of the foliage and flowers is very fine and bears witness to the virtuosity of an unidentified Parisian goldsmith.
An ill-known commission
Anne Hyde (1637-1671) was the daughter of the first earl of Clarendon and a lady-in-waiting to Mary Stuart, Princess of Orange. The Duke of York, future James II of England, married her in secrecy on September 3, 1660. This marriage provoked the fury of the queen mother, Henriette-Marie de France, who would not accept to meet her daughter-in-law till January 1661, after the birth of the couple's first child, Charles, duke of Cambridge, who was then baptized. This mirror, the central element of a toilet service given to Anne Hyde, was probably manufactured in this context. Such toilet services were given to girls at the time of their marriage and were often completed when their children were born. It may be that the mirror was offered to the Duchess of York at the time of her son's baptism, which accompanied the family's reconciliation. The precise circumstances of the commission are not known, but the French origins of the queen mother undoubtedly played a role in choosing the goldsmith.
The prototype of late seventeenth-century toilet mirrors
Of the rare toilet mirrors that have come down to us, Anne Hyde's is the oldest. The reference would have been to Anne of Austria's gold toilet service, a lost work by Claude I Ballin (circa 1615-1678). These toilet mirrors were part of a set that included candlesticks, ointment jars, various containers, and all the objects required for the ""toilet"" (meaning hairstyling and makeup). Three other French toilet services remain today: one is conserved in Rosenborg castle (Copenhagen), another in the Edinburgh museum, and the third in the collections of the duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. The latter is that of Mary II Stuart, daughter of the Duchess of York and Princess of Orange. By virtue of its shape and its floral decoration, it may be said that Anne of York's mirror announces that of her daughter.

The scene takes place on the shores of a lake in front of a marvelous palace. Venus is at her toilet, assisted by her retinue of maidens and cherubs. She is preparing to seduce Adonis. In the skies above the scene, other cherubs are repairing her chariot and feeding the swans that pull it. 

	Figures of grace
Venus is sitting half-naked on a low seat in front of the portico of a temple with Doric columns. A cherub is holding her mirror while another fastens her sandal. Two Graces standing behind her have nearly finished styling her hair, while a third is bringing a net sewn with pearls to complete the style. On the left, three cherubs are gathered round a small table. Venus has come to the shore to seduce Adonis. The Graces are helping her at her toilet.
	The scene is set against a seascape. Venus was of course born from sea foam. The temple of Knidos rises from the waves like an enchanted isle. To the right is a rich fountain decorated with figures and dolphins. Cupid is hovering over the scene singing of the sweetness of love, while winged cherubs are feeding ambrosia to the swans that are about to be yoked to Venus' chariot. Another cherub is leading two doves to drink at the fountain.

	A ducal commission
In 1621, Ferdinand Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, commissioned a series of four paintings on the theme of the elements for the Villa Favorita. Albani had already painted a series on the same theme for Prince Borghese some years earlier. This work is the first in a cycle of four episodes from the life of Venus. This cycle opposes Chastity and Sensual Love in the rival figures of Diana and Venus.
	Albani added further touches to this painting in 1633 when he was working in Florence for the Medici family, who purchased the series after Ferdinand Gonzaga's death.

	Albani: poetry in painting
Albani's preference for brightly lit scenes and figures with very pale skin reflects the influence of artists working in Venice during the Renaissance. The figures are full of grace and charm. The atmosphere of serene voluptuousness is a perfect alliance of natural beauty and allegory.
	Albani studied with the Carracci family, who created a new style of landscape painting in the early 17th century. Here, Albani has depicted the picturesque surroundings of Bologna, where he was living at the time. The figures are in perfect harmony with the setting of lush greenery, clear skies, and cool, pure waters. The atmosphere is one of gentle serenity. Albani has been called the Anacreon of painting, in reference to the Greek poet of the 5th century BC, who wrote lyrical poetry in praise of Venus and love.

This washbowl is part of a toilet set created for Françoise-Marie de Blois, Duchess of Chartres and Orléans, the legitimate daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Although the hallmarks are illegible, this piece is similar to the most impressive work done by Paris silversmiths for their royal clients and can fairly be attributed to the king's silversmith Nicolas Besnier.
Use of a washbowl
Usually accompanied by a ewer, the washbowl was not a new item in the eighteenth century; it had been used for performing ablutions since the Middle Ages. The practise of creating groups of articles required for the feminine toilet  goes back to the gold set made for Anne of Austria, none of whose forty pieces has come down to us. That set served, however, as a model for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Toilet sets were then much larger, their numerous pieces combining the useful and the luxurious. They also had a social role at a time when etiquette made the toilet a public affair: as can be seen in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century engravings, close friends were sometimes received while one was washing and dressing. These sets were generally offered as wedding gifts.
Client and silversmith
On the bottom of the bowl can be seen the arms of Françoise-Marie de Blois, Duchess of Chartres and Orléans. The bowl was accompanied by other items: two implement containers, two powder boxes, two small cups with handles and lids, a small saucer, a coffre en racine, a spittoon, a cream holder, a dish, and a large cup with lid, all in silver gilt. The Louvre washbowl was part of a set belonging to the duchess and was probably made when the Duke of Chartres, the future Regent, was obliged to marry her. There are similarities to the washbowl made for the Spanish Infanta Maria Anna Victoria and to a dish, also in the Louvre, bearing the Escalopier arms. That these two pieces were made by the same silversmith is indicated by ornamentation similar to that on the Duchess of Chartres's bowl and characteristic of Nicolas Besnier, royal silversmith at the Palais du Louvre. With Delaunay, Ballin, Germain, and Roëttiers, Besnier is considered one of the greatest silversmiths of the first half of the eighteenth century.
An emblematic Régence piece
This oval, boat-shaped bowl is set on an oblong base. The edge is raised at the ends and in the middle of the long sides. The ornamentation illustrates the sheer staying power of the decorative repertoire borrowed from antiquity: ovoli, tracery, frises de poste, and, on the sides, chubby children's heads. These heads form the handles and are to be found on other items of silverware and on the bronze decoration of certain pieces of furniture from the same period. In the middle of one of the long sides is a shell, a motif subjected to every imaginable deformation during the Rocaille period but treated with real restraint here. Engraved with great skill, this bowl is an example of a relatively belated ornamental vocabulary that makes it one of the most accomplished pieces of Régence silverware.

Influenced by the nearby Mesopotamian culture, the Hurrians adopted the custom of depositing documents in the foundations of their buildings to protect them from destruction and ensure their stability. The two tablets of copper and stone, laid under the claws of a snarling lion with peg-shaped hindquarters, contain the oldest known text in the Hurrian language.  
The oldest known inscription in Hurrian
The deposit is composed of several parts. A snarling lion with peg-shaped hindquarters has its forepaws on a copper tablet. Most of the inscription on the tablet has been erased but the same inscription is repeated in Hurrian and cuneiform writing on a white stone tablet placed underneath it: ""Tishatal, [Endan] king of Urkish, has built a temple for the god Nergal. May the god Nubadag protect this temple. May Nubadag destroy whomsoever seeks to destroy [it]; may his god not listen to his prayers. May the Lady of Nagar, [the sun god] Shimiga, and the god of the storm [curse 10,000 times whomsoever might seek to destroy it]."" It is the oldest known text written in Hurrian, a language which is neither Semitic nor Indo-European.  
The Hurrians
The Hurrians appear in Mesopotamian writing in about 2400 BC. At the time, they lived in the foothills of the Taurus and Zagros mountain chains bordering the Mesopotamian plain to the north and the east. This huge territory between the upper reaches of the Tigris and the Euphrates was known as Subir in Sumerian, and Subartu in Akkadian. The city of Urkish, where this foundation deposit probably comes from, was the political center and the main place of worship for the Hurrians in the first centuries of their history. It has recently been identified with the site of Tell Mozan in the Khabur Valley of the Djezireh Desert, Syria. 
An original foundation deposit
In Mesopotamian tradition, deposits were placed in the foundations of buildings as a symbolic mooring supposed to protect them from destruction. Such deposits were usually composed of a peg topped with the bust of a figure such as the founding king's personal god or his animal attribute, and a tablet bearing an inscription. The figure of the lion and the position of the tablets in the Urkish foundation deposit make a homogeneous set, which is distinct from the deposits of the Sumerian kings of southern Mesopotamia, Gudea of Lagash. and the kings of the Ur empire, who were contemporaries of Tishatal of Urkish. The lion, an animal that traditionally guarded gates throughout the history of Mesopotamia, has a twin in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Both foundation pegs were intended to protect the name of the prince who built the temple and to ensure the stability and durability of the temple of the god Nergal, the god of the underworld, in the city of Urkish.

This huge statue of Athena, found in Velletri in the eighteenth century, is a copy of a bronze effigy, now lost, known from Roman copies and fragments of antique casts, found in Baia, near Naples. The original, dating from about 430 BC, is generally attributed to Cresilas, a Cretan sculptor who also produced a portrait of Pericles, a copy of which is in the British Museum. The hero's oval face and sharply defined features are strikingly similar to those of the goddess.
The Pallas of Velletri: an exceptional discovery
In 1797 Vicenzo Pacetti, an art restorer, discovered a huge statue, more than three meters tall, in the ruins of a Roman villa near Velletri, a small Italian town whose name has now become synonymous with the copies of this style of statue. The helmet and aegis (a breastplate edged with serpents and with the head of the Gorgon Medusa fixed in the center) indicate that the statue represents the goddess Athena-known by the Romans as Pallas or Minerva. The statue was purchased by the French commissioners of the Directoire and taken to Rome before being confiscated by Neapolitan troops in 1798 and moved to the royal collections in Naples. On 28 March 1798, the work was handed over to France by the Treaty of Florence. It has been on display in the Louvre since December 1803.
A copy of a work dating from the late 5th century BC
This monumental work is a copy of a bronze effigy on the same scale, now lost, although several Roman copies survive. Fragments of antique casts were also found during the excavation of a Roman workshop specializing in copies of ancient works, in Baia, near Naples. It is likely that these fragments were cast from the original, confirming the size and the material of the original statue, which probably dated from the Classical period, in the late 5th century BC. The small size of the aegis, the goddess's long, sleeved tunic, and her cloak or himation, gathered at the hips in a large triangular drape, are all characteristic of the period. The solemn, hieratic pose of the goddess, her attributes, and the folds of the cloth are influenced by the Athenas sculpted by Phidias, such as the Athena Parthenos and the Athena Promachos.
A sculpture attributed to Cresidas
The original from which this statue was copied has sometimes been identified as the statue sculpted by Alcamenes in about 430-420 BC for the interior of the temple of Hephaistos on the agora in Athens. However, the style of the goddess's facial features makes it more likely that the statue is the work of the Cretan sculptor Cresilas, who worked on the Acropolis in Athens in the late 5th century BC. The regular oval shape of the face, together with the sharply defined brows, eyes, and nose, are strikingly similar to the bust of Pericles wearing a helmet, now in the British Museum. The bust is a copy of the statue of the strategist that Cresilas produced in about 430 BC, according to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History (34.25). This work is mentioned again in the second century AD by the traveler Pausanias, in his Periegesis (1.28.2), when it was in the Acropolis in Athens. The Pallas of Velletri is therefore likely to be a Roman copy of an original by the Cretan master sculptor, although it is impossible to say precisely which statue, whether the original was religious in nature, and what building the original was made for.

Arriving in Paris from Marseilles in 1835, Dominique Papety frequented the studio of Léon Cogniet and in 1836 won the Grand Prix de Rome. Between 1837 and 1842, he came under the influence of Ingres, then director of the Villa Medici, who held his art in high regard. In Rome, he met François Sabatier, a young aesthete and great lover of antiquity whom he accompanied on his travels to Greece in 1846, returning with hundreds of drawings, of which this view of Athens is one of the best examples.
A ""documentary"" on Greece
In Rome, François Sabatier introduced Papety to the teachings of Charles Fourier, which gave the young painter the idealist subject for his first painting shown at the Salon of 1843, A Dream of Happiness, which met with great success (Compiègne, Musée Vivenel). The two men established a strong friendship and from April to August 1846 they traveled together to Greece to explore ancient sites and return to the source of Western civilization. They arrived in Corfu, then visited the Ionian Islands, the Peloponnese, Delphi, Athens, and the monasteries of Mount Athos. Papety brought back a comprehensive and detailed pictorial record of the journey, including landscapes, archaeological plans, and copies. After returning to France, he published an account of their travels in the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1847, testimony to painters' growing interest in Hellenism in the year of the foundation of the École française d'Athènes. In 1890, Sabatier bequeathed to the Louvre five albums and 130 loose sheets representing the greater part of the drawings Papety had produced in Greece.
A view of Athens in 1846
Papety's work demonstrates his interest in antiquity, which he did not, however, isolate from its contemporary context. In addition to meticulous archaeological plans, he produced numerous landscapes and studies of the customs, costumes, and crafts of Greece, as well as of the traces of Turkish occupation. These studies are usually annotated, with information about colors and orientation, topographical details, titles, and precise dates - the work of an archaeologist, ethnologist, and journalist. This view of Athens thus offers a precise depiction of the city walls and the monuments of antiquity, but also of the 13th-century Frankish tower that was destroyed in 1875. It also shows the surrounding hills, including Likavittós in the background, and the modern city lying on the plain; the large white building on the right is the palace of King Otto. It was the newly crowned king of Greece who provided Papety with the occasion for a second visit to Athens in August 1847. On the suggestion of the Duc de Montpensier, he was invited to portray the royal family and the court, with a view to producing a painting to commemorate a recent political event, the duke's visiting the monuments of Athens on September 12, 1845. After this second journey, from which he brought back some thirty drawings, Papety fell ill, and died two years later in Marseilles at the age of 34.

Protective genii are supernatural beings who watch over humans or buildings and ward off evil spirits. This winged genius, along with one directly opposite, guarded the gates of the city of Khorsabad. It blessed all those who passed by it with water sprinkled from a pine cone.

A protective and blessing genius
The site of Khorsabad (called Dur-Sharrukin in antiquity), which was excavated between 1843 and 1854 by Paul-Emile Botta and Victor Place, yielded orthostats, carved slabs of stone that protected and adorned the bases of brick walls. This monumental winged genius, represented frontally, was placed in the inner passage of one of the city gates. Another genius was located directly opposite. Both stood immediately behind the pair of winged bulls with human heads that guarded the gate. Like other genii placed at certain entrances to the palace, this one has a protective role. However it also performed a blessing function: from the pine cone, which could be shaken, liquid drawn from a little bucket was sprinkled over the passageway and those who passed along it.
A monumental sculpture
This colossal figure carved in high relief depicts a winged, bearded genius, shown frontally as far as the waist and in profile below. He holds a pine cone in his right hand and a small metal vessel (or situla) in his left hand.The face, framed by a curly beard, is surmounted by a tiara adorned with two pairs of horns. Over the figure's short tunic is a fringed cape, which covers the right shoulder and left leg. Two pairs of wings emerge from the back and spread symmetrically on either side of the body. His arms and forearms are adorned with rings and bracelets. He wears sandals, which cover his heels.On the base of this sculpture is a game of tick-tack-toe, scratched into it in ancient times, probably by sentries passing the time while on duty at the gate.
Genii: between the human and the divine?
Genii, depicted as bulls with human heads, men with birds' heads, and winged men, figure prominently in Assyrian mythology. They are creatures endowed with powers superior to those of human beings, yet they are not great deities, although they are sometimes represented with some of their attributes, for example, the horned tiara here. These supernatural beings had the power to ward off evil spirits. The genius seen here had an essentially protective role: it defended the gates and walls of the city. However, it was also a blessing genius, which held holy water and sprinkled it on visitors with a pine cone. Genii are often depicted in Assyrian art, especially in ceremonial scenes where they are shown pollinating the sacred palm tree.

An important source of information concerning Annibale Carracci's drawing style in his Bologna years, this group study constitutes the more or less final project for the first fresco in the Romulus and Remus cycle in the great hall of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. Romulus and Remus Suckled by the She-Wolf is the most surprising fresco in this cycle executed by all three Carraccis, notably because of the important role played by landscape for the first time here.
The abandonment of the twins
The iconography follows Plutarch's narrative: King Amulius orders a hunter to kill the twins, but instead the latter simply abandons them to a cruel she-wolf. However, the animal not only spares them but also suckles them. In the fresco, the hunter is no more than a silhouette on the horizon to the right, while the wolf figure is more imposing and distinct. Analysis of the fresco has brought to light pentimenti and retouches to the dry paint, notably on the hunter figure which, originally painted as it was in the drawing, was later erased and moved to the horizon, thus clearing the foreground.
Preparatory drawings
There are few surviving drawings for this decorative cycle executed in 1590-1 by the three Carraccis. According to their biographer Malvasia (1616-93), they declared that ""Ella è de' Carracci: l'abbiam fatta tutti noi"" (This is by the Carraccis, we all made it""), but it is fairly easy to tell the three artists apart here, which is not always the case with other group drawings identified to date. In addition to the one by Annibale now in the Louvre, to Agostino's Triumph of Romulus over Acron at Windsor Castle, and Lodovico's Death of Amulius in Berlin, we should also include here the drawing with gouache highlights at Chatsworth, entitled The Battle between the Romans and the Sabines, even if the fresco is probably by Agostino. Formerly attributed to Ciro Ferri, the ensemble drawing for the fresco depicting Remus taken before Amulius, also in the Louvre, must now be credited to Agostino. Among the detail studies are a telamon in black chalk, on the back of the Windsor Castle drawing, which may be by Annibale or Agostino; a study of a seated telamon by Agostino in the Louvre; two other telamones by Annibale, also in the Louvre; and a detail of masks in red chalk at the Albertina in Vienna, again by Annibale.
Hints of Carracci's Roman style
This landscape seems indicative of Annibale's approach before he left for Rome in 1595. Already we can see his consummate skill in the rendering of landscape, evoked largely by touches of wash with, in the foreground, vigorous pen detailing, his understanding of the human body (in the walking figure) and his freedom in relation to the conventions of late Mannerism. This piece hints at the mature style of his Roman works and heralds the Farnese cycle, which in spirit anticipates the seventeenth century.

The legend of the founders of Rome is told most notably by Livy: born of the god Mars and the vestal virgin Rhea Silvia, the twin brothers were set adrift in a cradle on the Tiber River.
The legend of the founding of Rome
In his writings Livy (Titus Livius) recounts the origins of the Eternal City. Twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, born of the god Mars and the vestal priestess Rhea Silvia, were set adrift on the Tiber River in a cradle. They were discovered by Faustulus, the herdsman of the king of Alba's flocks. The scene shows the shepherd bringing one of the abandoned children to his wife. With his left hand he indicates the presence of the other child, suckled by the she-wolf, to the right. The man's face displays an unshakeable will. The woman leaves her work and accepts the newborn into her arms: this saving gesture sets the ground for the foundation of Rome and the destruction of Alba. A dove, symbolizing Venus, mother of Aeneas and thus ancestor to the twins, alights on the thatched roof of an open structure, within which a servant is busy at her tasks.
A baroque rhetoric
The monumental character of the figures and the tanned skin of the men, in contrast to the pearly complexion of the women in antique dress, accentuate the work's dynamism and sense of fantasy. The hands lead the viewer to the primary center of action. The scene's legibility partakes of the preoccupations of the baroque style.The eye is drawn to a patch of blue sky, which reveals the immensity of the surrounding area. The rustic setting evokes genre painting and the theme of the Adoration of the Shepherds - creating a union of ancient morals and Christian virtue. 
A prestigious destination
This work comes from the collection of Louis Phélypeaux de La Vrillière, secretary of state to Louis XIV. With nine other works of the same dimensions inspired by Greek and Roman historical themes, this collection was destined to adorn the Hôtel de Toulouse in Paris, today the Banque de France. Guido Reni's painting The Abduction of Helen, also in the Louvre, was perhaps the first work to find a place in this gallery.

This drawing is related to a work painted by Ingres in 1812 in Rome, The Triumph of Romulus over Acron, which depicts a founding episode of Roman history, inspired by Plutarch. In spite of the erroneous date marked on the drawing, it is a late memento of this painting, which is now in the Louvre.
A classical episode
The composition shows Romulus, the mythical founder of Rome, who has just triumphed over the Ceninenses, a people near Rome, following the rape of the Sabine women. Acron, king of the Ceninenses, is lying on the ground on the right. Romulus has taken the spolia opima and is taking them in a procession to Jupiter's temple. Ingres followed Plutarch's story of the Life of Romulus. The frieze-style composition is scattered with classical references, such as the rearing horse on the right, evoking a famous classical example, one of the two Dioscuri horses in the Piazza del Quirinale.
Decoration for Napoleon
Emperor of France, Napoleon was also king of Italy. As he was to go to Rome in 1812, several painters, including Ingres, were commissioned to produce works to decorate his future apartments at the Palazzo di Monte Cavallo in the Quirinale. The Triumph of Romulus over Acron was intended to decorate the second salon of the empress's apartment. The work was given to Napoleon III by Pope Pius IX and finally housed in the Louvre. Ingres made several drawings a long time after completing the painting. However, he (wrongly) dated them with the date he remembered having painted the picture. The Louvre has another large memento drawing of the same subject but with substantial variants, whereas this one reproduces the original canvas.
Stylization and archaism
The large drawn bas-relief certainly reflects the influence of Neoclassical sculptors and the search for ""ideal beauty"" which, according to Winckelmann's theories, could only be found in the respect of the classical. Contours are strongly accentuated and watercolor evokes the fresco appearance of the painting. Ingres was familiar with the practice of endlessly returning to old works to improve them and, as here, make them more stylized.

A pen and brown ink drawing of the Trojan horse, a theme from Virgil's Aeneid, this work is no doubt one of Girodet's most astonishing sheets because of its vigor and verve. Pen drawing is in fact the real subject of the drawing, vibrant with energy; in it, Girodet gave new impetus to line drawing.
Hidden intruders
This drawing in pen and brown ink shows the Greek invaders within the city of Troy, a scene recounted by Virgil in the Aeneid. The wooden horse built by Epeos (whose name is written on the animal's left leg) has been dragged into the city and the Greeks are starting to emerge from their hiding place. The last warriors are coming out of the horse's neck, marked with the Athenian owl to identify the attackers.
Classicism assumes a somber tone
Neoclassicism's favorite poet was Homer, who was very popular in the late 18th century. But about 1800, he was supplanted by Virgil, whose Collected Works were published by Didot in 1798. As illustrators, the publisher chose young artists recommended by David, including Girodet, who made a distinguished contribution to the work. In shifting from Homer to Virgil, from the Greek epic to the Latin poem, classicism assumed a more somber tone: the Aeneid is above all the saga of the defeated. This funereal liturgy, which was easy for people to identify with during the Revolution, is a stately dirge of sound and fury which culminates in the fall of Troy.
The violation of the palace
The artist shows the episode from the Trojans' point of view. He sets the scene between two strong columns decorated with trophies and linked with garlands (an allusion to the festive reception given to the horse). The architecture in the foreground, perhaps Priam's palace, which a Greek on a ladder is trying to break into, symbolically suggests the transgression of the threshold: the enemies have entered the impregnable city. Better still, the framework indicates a point of view, deliberately choosing the Trojan side. The scene is described from their ramparts. It is thus not by chance that the artist has depicted the dozing, useless guards, a pathetic metaphor of the destiny of the defeated. Girodet gives new impetus to line drawing: in his hand, line conveys life rather than an idea; it is the vector of movement used to render the turmoil of the scene and the feverishness of the attack. His capricious, twisting, mercurial line floods the page with energy, seeking less to illustrate than to translate the event, focusing on the effect rather than the idea.

This view of Arco, a rocky outcrop topped by a citadel to the north of Lake Garda, is one of Dürer's finest and most elaborate landscapes. It was executed in 1495 when he was returning from his first trip to Italy, along the road from Venice to his native city of Nuremberg. On the way, Dürer executed about fifteen watercolor landscapes, now found in Vienna, Berlin, Bremen, and London. This is one of the best known.
The Return from Italy
One fine spring morning in 1495, when Dürer was traveling from Venice to Brenner via Trent, he stopped near Arco, a citadel perched on a rocky outcrop north of Lake Garda. He had come from Venice, where he could well have seen landscapes by Carpaccio, Cima da Conegliano, and Bellini, and was on his way to Nuremberg. No doubt he had wanted to see Lake Garda and was suddenly struck by the spectacle of nature coming to life in early spring and of a fortress, which perhaps stirred memories of his homeland. The annotation is believed to have been added circa 1502-1503; the monogram is also a later addition. 
Two phases
This work seems unfinished only in the centre right, whereas all the other watercolors painted during Dürer's first Italian sojourn make good use of unfinished effects to suggest immediacy. Most of these watercolors date from the journey to Venice. The more elaborate appearance of this work may be due to greater stylistic maturity; however, the foreground may also have been added later - the colors are different and the style is rather drier than in the main subject. The pale tonalities of the watercolors may be the result of Mantegna's influence.
Power, balance, and clarity
Dürer's watercolor landscapes have a special place in European art circa 1500 but generated no immediate imitators, even among his pupils. Here, while accurately describing the topographical features of the site, Dürer has tried to capture the poetic light and color of the spring landscape. The gray-blue of the olive trees and the very pale tones of the watercolors are evocative of the countryside in early morning. Dürer has admirably rendered the vegetation, especially the grape vines. The crenellations on the walls around the little village are perhaps slightly oversized, but they emphasize Dürer's interest in protective fortifications. Similarly, the mountains that tower above the outcrop have been deliberately omitted to focus attention on the central motif. And indeed a feeling of tempered, balanced power emanates from this fresh, luminous watercolor.

This delightfully fresh watercolor once belonged to Hugh A. J. Munro of Novar, one of Turner's executors and keenest admirers. It is one of the seventeen watercolors printed in the annual magazine The Keepsake, which was very popular in England in the 19th century. Turner contributed to the magazine between 1828 and 1839. It was the first of his drawings to be purchased by the Louvre, in 1976.
Turner and France
Turner went to France several times after 1802. On each occasion he made short excursions, which gave him an opportunity to note his impressions in his sketchbooks. These studies gave rise to very few oil paintings; however, they were used for more finished drawings suitable for publication. This is the case with View of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which was engraved by Robert Wallis for the 1832 edition of the annual The Keepsake.
The Annuals
The public discovered landscapes around the Seine in the elegant album The Keepsake, which Charles Heath (1785-1848) published in November or December each year beginning in 1827. Turner prepared watercolors for this publication as finished works intended for public display, which could be exhibited and sold to publicize the new edition of the annual. All the French subjects in The Keepsake come from ideas noted for the first time in pen and ink on small blue paper sheets. The studies for View of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye are in the notebook titled Paris and Its Surrounds (London, Tate Gallery). He used these notes to make a more elaborate drawing (London, Tate Gallery), which is smaller than the watercolor but shows the main features of the finished work.
A panoramic view
The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a royal abode linked to English history because the Stuart king James II died there, was in a pitiful state in the 1820s; only the terraces above the Seine still attracted visitors. For this view, Turner positioned himself opposite the castle, near the river, accentuating the figures sitting on the river bank and on the scaffolding on the bridge over the Seine. In the foreground, a woman is looking at what seems to be a painting, no doubt an allusion to the castle's former splendor. Executed at a time of intense creative activity, the watercolor is appealing in its flowing strokes and beautiful colors, dominated by reds, ochre, and yellows. Bathed in light, this recollection of a journey heralds the boldness of Turner's evanescent, lyrical later landscapes. A color study (London, Tate Gallery) in which the structure of the composition is obtained solely by the use of plum and pink tones has been linked to this work.

Human-headed winged bulls were protective genies called shedu or lamassu, and were placed as guardians at certain gates or doorways of the city and the palace. Symbols combining man, bull, and bird, they offered protection against enemies.
A protective genie to guard the city
When in around 713 BC Sargon II founded his capital, Dur Sharrukin, present-day Khorsabad, he enclosed it, together with several palaces, within a great wall of unbaked brick pierced by seven gates. Protective genies were placed on either side of these entrances to act as guardians. They also had a strictly architectural function, as they bore some of the weight of the arch above. The excavations undertaken by Paul Botta, beginning in 1843, saw the site cleared and revealed some of the works, which were sent to the Louvre. The drawings and meticulous surveys done then by Eugène Flandin, to be complemented a decade later by the work of Victor Place, indicate the original position of these winged bulls. This one formed the left jamb of Door K in the palace.
A monumental sculpture
Carved from a single block, it stands more than 4 meters high by 4 meters wide and is a meter in depth. The head is sculpted in the round, the rest of the body in high relief. High relief was much prized in the time of Sargon II, when modeling became more marked.The head, the only human element, whose ears are those of a bull, has a man's bearded face with very precisely modeled features. The eyes are expressive, the thick eyebrows meet above a prominent nose. The kindly mouth is surmounted by a thin mustache. A curly beard covers the jaw and chin, while the hair falls down to the shoulders, framing the face. This human head wears a starred tiara, flanked by pairs of horns and topped by a row of feathers.The body, its anatomy very precisely rendered, is that of a bull: the beast has not four but five legs, so that it looks as if standing still when seen from the front, and as if walking when seen from the side. From the shoulders spring the wings of a bird of prey, only one being visible, curving above the back; broad panels of curls cover the breast, belly, back, and rump. The tail is very long and curly at the end. An inscription on two panels between the hind legs of the bull praises the ruler by rehearsing his virtues and calls down a curse on whomever should seek to harm the edifice.These bulls are motifs of Syrian inspiration and one of the characteristic features of the decoration of Assyrian palaces. They make their first appearance at Nimrud in the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, to disappear again after the reign of Ashurbanipal.

This ""vessel"" pot pourri in the shape of a ship bears ""Chinese"" decoration on a pink ground. The shape was created by Jean-Claude Duplessis (circa 1695-1774) and the decoration painted by Charles-Nicolas Dodin (1734-1803). This object, which was part of the mantelpiece garniture in the chamber of Madame de Pompadour (1721-1764) at the Hôtel d'Evreux, is emblematic of the Rocaille style and the taste of the king's ""favorite"" for ""Chinese""-style decoration on a pink ground.
A shape created by Jean-Claude Duplessis
The pot pourri ""vessel"" shape, which evokes the goldworked 'nefs' (or 'ships') of the royal tables, is one of the most famous and original shapes of the Sèvres Manufactory. It was created by Jean-Claude Duplessis, who was responsible for a considerable number of models at Sèvres in a new repertory that was marked by the Rocaille style. The plaster model is still conserved at the manufactory. This pot-pourri comprises two parts: a vase in the form of a ship set on a scroll-footed base and an openwork lid simulating the mast of a ship. Each extremity is decorated with a lion's head in relief, a bowsprit protruding from the mouth. Nine other examples of this model are known, now in the British royal collections, the Wallace Collection in London, Waddesdon Manor, the Frick Collection in New York, the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu.
Decoration attributed to Charles-Nicolas Dodin
The decoration of this pot pourri, attributed to Charles-Nicolas Dodin (1734-1803) like the ""dolphin"" pot pourri that accompanied it, stands out against a rare pink ground, a color that appeared at Sèvres in 1757, here heightened with blue and green. An oblong space was left in reserve on each face, forming a cartouche encircled by green palms and combed gold. The scene on the cartouche is of Chinese inspiration; it represents three figures sitting on a terrace, undoubtedly playing the game of ""go"" at a round table. The cartouche on the reverse contains flowered branches of Oriental inspiration. Between 1760 and 1763, Dodin painted at least twenty-five pieces with Chinese decoration, a type of decoration that Madame de Pompadour seems to have greatly appreciated. The scene on the pot-pourri in the Louvre is an interpretation of an engraving by Gabriel Huquier père (1697-1772), after a work by François Boucher (1703-1770), The Tea. Like most of the pieces with Chinese decoration created at Sèvres, this work is quite fanciful.
A garniture from the Hôtel d'Evreux
The Hôtel d'Evreux, built in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré by Armand-Claude Mollet between 1718 and 1720 for Henri Louis de la Tour d'Auvergne, count of Evreux, was acquired by Madame de Pompadour in 1753. It was a large townhouse that the king's favorite had transformed, refurbishing the decoration in contemporary style. There in particular she kept an important collection of porcelain. In her chamber was a mantelpiece garniture comprising the Louvre's ""vessel"" pot pourri, a pair of ""fountain"" or ""dolphin"" pot pourris conserved at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and two ""girandole"" or ""sconced"" pot pourris, of which the present location is unknown. This garniture was delivered to her on May 30, 1760, along with two candelabra, which are also conserved in the Louvre.

This bronze statuette, formerly in the Crown collections, represents Attis, the Phrygian god who was Cybele's lover. He is wearing an oriental costume: a tunic strewn with copper- and silver-incrusted designs, and ""anaxyrides"" (slashed breeches) attached to the legs by small round buckles. The unusual arrangement of the garment, which stands wide open, revealing the belly and genitals, evokes the orgiastic nature of the myth in which Attis emasculated himself in a mad frenzy.
A bronze formerly belonging to the Crown collections
According to the general inventory of the Royal Furniture Repository, where it appears as no. 64, this bronze statuette entered the Crown collection before 1684. It would seem that a modern head had already been added by that date, tilted too far back and placed too near the neck. However, no mention was made of the restoration work until 1722. Judging by the similarities in workmanship, the same bronzecaster also reinstated the right hand, which was only declared to be modern in 1802. Many classical works were restored in this way, to disguise their fragmentary state, which did not accord with the esthetic criteria of the time.
The Phrygian god Attis
The statuette, whose provenance and place of manufacture remain unknown, represents Attis, the Phrygian god in the service of Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, and was made in the first or second century AD. The god has the features of a young boy dancing and is dressed in oriental costume: a long-sleeved tunic made from a single piece of fabric, a belt above the abdomen, and ""anaxyrides"" (slashed breeches) fastened to the legs with small round buckles. The fabric of the garment is strewn with designs - croses, rosettes, quatrefoils, etc. - and incrusted with copper and silver. Originally, the boy will probably have been wearing a Phrygian cap, as seen in other representations of the god.
An orgiastic episode in the legend of Attis
The unusual arrangement of the garment, which leaves the boy's belly and genitalia exposed, recalls the orgiastic character of the myth of Attis and is a prelude to the episode of his self-mutilation. There are several versions of this act of lunacy. The most famous description of the punishment inflicted on her lover by Cybele is that given by Ovid. Attis was struck with frenzy by the goddess for having loved a nymph and thereby lost his virginity. In the grip of this torment, he mutilated himself. The legend seems to refer to the eunuchs who served as priests in the oriental cult of Cybele. This cult was widespread throughout the Greek and then the Roman world from the third century BC, and gave rise to many small effigies of Cybele and her young lover, Attis.

This colossal capital from one of the thirty-six monumental columns which supported the roof of the apadana at Susa is evidence of an architectural tradition purely Iranian. It is typical of Achaemenid art in combining elements taken from different civilizations to form a coherent stylistic ensemble.

	The audience hall in the administrative capital

	When Darius the Great succeeded Cyrus, he chose the city of Susa as the administrative capital of his unified empire. He undertook the construction of a palace complex on three natural terraces overlooking the city from the north. There he built a royal palace in the Mesopotamian tradition, onto which opened a vast audience hall, in Persian called an apadana. This was a hypostyle (columned) hall, 109 meters square.

	A composite capital

	The 36 columns of the hall stood 21 metres in height. Each consists of a square base inscribed with the name of the king, and a fluted shaft recalling the Ionian style, surmounted by three successive elements: a basket-like ensemble of palm-fronds borrowed from Egypt, an arrangement of double volutes with rosettes taken from the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and above this the foreparts of two kneeling bulls, back to back. The beam rested in the gap between the necks of the animals. This pair of bull protomes reproduces an old Mesopotamian motif symbolizing the cosmic equilibrium. The capital in the Louvre was reconstructed from fragments of several columns, discovered by Marcel  Dieulafoy during his excavations of 1884-86. It is this that explains the variations in the color of the stone. This is a veined gray limestone brought to the plain of Susa from the Zagros Mountains, rather than the traditional unbaked brick.

	A purely Iranian style

	The Darius’s foundation charter for the city tells us that it was Greek and Lydian stonemasons who carved the Susan columns. The model they worked from was created by Persian architects, who deliberately – and most probably by royal command – combined several styles to demonstrate the unification of the different parts of the empire. This capital is typical of Achaemenid art in combining elements taken from different civilizations to form, nonetheless, a coherent stylistic ensemble. Furthermore, the use of columns, although rare, was not unknown in the Iranian world: it can be seen in the buildings of Hasanlu in the 9th century BC, and in Luristan in the 8th. It was collaboration with Greek architects which allowed this column-based architecture to reach such a point of development and make possible the construction of buildings on a hitherto unexampled scale.

This cup is typical of the Chalcidian style that emerged in southern Italy. The decoration, consisting of human or satyr ears flanking enormous eyes, is remarkably refined. Chalcidian pottery borrowed the forms invented in Corinthian workshops, but its style was influenced by Attic black-figure production. Chalcidian pottery was very successful, with an enormous number of vessels being exported to Etruria.
Chalcidian pottery
The immigrants who came from Chalcis, the capital of the island of Euboea, to settle in southern Italy set up their own workshops. Spurred on by competition and eager to please their new clientele, they tried to adapt their production to local tastes by devoting space to narrative scenes. Excavations have uncovered a large number of vases, which confirm a flourishing output over forty years and a widespread circulation in the west. In Reggio di Calabria, over a hundred Chalcidian vases have been discovered.Chalcidian workshops absorbed the influences of Corinthian workshops, particularly in their final phase (550-530 BC). At the same time, Chalcidian artists knew and imitated the Attic black-figure style, the popularity of which is demonstrated by the large number of vessels that were exported to Etruria. This was the only pottery capable of rivaling the Attic pottery of the late 6th century.Several of these vases bear inscriptions in the Chalcidian alphabet. For this reason, they were at one time thought to have been made in Euboea, or in Chalcis itself, but nothing has been found in Euboea to support this theory.
The decoration
Scenes of conversation, horsemen, chariots setting off, or battles between warriors are more frequently represented than mythological or heroic scenes. Animal zones constitute a secondary decoration beside the figured representations; on small vases they occupy the surface alone. These friezes, as well as the abundance of additional ornamental elements, demonstrate a great decorative sense. The details of the figures are generally less carefully drawn, but the compositions are elegant and symmetrical. Polychromy is abundant, the drawing is precise and refined, and the representations are pleasing, if slightly ""provincial"" and conventional. The most common forms are the neck amphora, the hydria, and the cup.
The cup with Chalcidian eyes
Cups of this type, apart from the tronconic foot, are imitations of the type A Attic cup and display a remarkably refined style of drawing. Unlike those on Attic cups, the eyes are flanked by human or satyr ears, and are accompanied by a nose.Decorative as well as apotropaic (prophylactic), the eyes are a series of concentric circles, with the black inner disc representing the dilated pupil. The anthropomorphic appearance of the vase is accentuated by the presence of stylized ears, adorned with earrings, and the nose.The eyes may have been intended to ward off the evil eye, or the evil spells of the brew that the vase contained. Or they may simply have been safeguards. Or they may be a reference to Dionysian exultation. Perhaps they created the effect of a ""living mask"" when the drinker lifted his cup to drink. Or did they evoke the face of the god Dionysius himself? Notice how, on the other side, the nose is replaced by the kantharos, the Dionysian vase par excellence.

The recording of the harvest and the annual survey of agricultural land after the Nile flood, which displaced the marker stones, were two of the foundations of Egyptian bureaucracy. The unit of length was the cubit (of approximately 52.5 cm), and this is a particularly well-preserved cubit rod, which bears the name of a high official, Maya, royal treasurer under Tutankhamun and Horemheb.
A detailed measuring rod
This rule is a hardwood rod of rectangular profile, which has one beveled edge and so five longitudinal surfaces. The beveled surface offers precious information: on the left are marked the digit (here 1.86 cm) and the palm (7.47 cm), while on the right the graduations show the royal cubit of 7 palms (52.3 cm) and the common cubit of 6. The other graduations correspond to units less frequently employed. On the vertical face beneath the bevel, on the right, are fifteen digits marked with their subdivisions, ranging from halves to sixteenths, the appropriate fractions being inscribed above each. On the upper surface, each of the twenty-eight digits is coupled with the name of a god, beginning on the right with Ra.
The dedication
On the bottom surface is a hieroglyphic inscription in which Maya calls upon the priests of an unidentified temple to pronounce the formula for the distribution of offerings from the god’s table:“Maya, the fan-bearer on the right hand of the king, royal scribe, head of the Double Treasury of the Master of the Two Lands, says: 'O pure priests, lector-priests of the temple, the gods of your cities will hear your prayers, you will prosper from your offices and enjoy a fine old age, if you pronounce my name and if you do for me as for one who enjoys the favor of his master, [for] the fan-bearer on the right hand of the king, who is at the feet of the master of the Two Lands, who has not left the side of the Good God [the king] wherever his feet have led him . . .'”Despite bearing signs of extensive use, this cubit rod is thus a votive object, intended, in the same way as a stele or a statue, to help ensure Maya’s eternal life. Other cubit rods are known, made of stone, which were deposited as ex-votos in temples by high officials. Another, entirely gilt, found in the tomb of the architect Kha, was a gift from the king (Museo Egizio, Turin)
Maya, the king's treasurer and overseer of works
The cubit rod was also employed by architects. Among his other high offices, Maya is also several times identified as overseer of works. In a graffito on the wall of the tomb of Thutmosis IV in the Valley of the Kings, no doubt by his own hand, he says that he has restored the tomb by the king’s command. Very close to Tutankhamun, he left his name on a number of objects in the latter’s tomb. His own tomb, visited by Richard Lepsius in 1843, was forgotten then rediscovered by an Anglo-Dutch archaeological team in 1986. In the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden there is a superb life-size statue of Maya accompanied by his wife Merit.

Although the headrest or ""bed-head"" is hardly used in the modern world, this little furniture item looks surprisingly modern, practical, and elegant-as do many pieces of furniture from Pharaonic Egypt.
A functional and elegant piece of furniture
This supple yet firm headrest was assembled by fitting two indented pieces of wood together; it must have been considerably more stable than those which consisted of a central pillar on an oblong base. The reassuring impression of stability is reinforced by the design of the legs: two pairs of clawed feet, which grasp the little crosspiece that joins them. The feline paw was a frequent decorative motif in Egyptian furniture that was perfectly compatible with a functional structure. Two little ivory inlays join in the center, where the two sections meet. The claws are also inlaid with ivory, which stands out vividly against the red-brown wood.
Sleeping with a headrest
The headrest was a common item of furniture in Pharaonic antiquity. During the Old Kingdom, its form was inspired by the pillars of large-scale architecture. Some headrests were made of stone and may have been specially produced for tombs. During the first half of the New Kingdom, in the 18th Dynasty, it was customary for the deceased to be buried with his belongings, so many authentic furniture items from this period have survived, with traces of wear to prove that they really were used in houses. The curved neck rest of this piece appears to be polished by use.
A chapter from the Book of the Dead: the formula for the headrest
In the New Kingdom Book of the Dead, one chapter (43, according to Egyptologists' numbering scheme) is illustrated with the image of a headrest. The text of one version is as follows: 
""The Chapter of Not Letting the Head of a Man Be Cut Off from His Body in Khert-Neter The Osiris Ani saith: I am a Great One, the son of a Great One. [I am] Fire, the son of Fire, to whom was given his head after it had been cut off. The head of Osiris was not removed from his body, and the head of Osiris Ani shall not be removed from his body. I have knitted myself together, I have made myself whole and complete. I shall renew my youth. I am Osiris Himself, the Lord of Eternity."" (translated by E. A. Wallis Budge)
The headrest was the natural place of protection for the deceased's head. During the Middle Kingdom, it was placed under the head of the mummy. During the Late Period, a hematite amulet in the form of a headrest was inserted into the wrappings under the mummy's neck.

Discovered in 1698 in Golconda, India, this stone immediately attracted the interest of Thomas Pitt, the English governor of Madras. Cut in England, it was then purchased for the French Crown at the behest of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans in 1717. The Regent surpassed in beauty and weight all the diamonds known in the western world until that time. Even today, its flawless brilliance and perfect cut ensure that it is still considered the finest diamond in the world.

	How the ""Regent"" was acquired and then cut in England

	Following its discovery in India in 1698, the stone was acquired by Thomas Pitt, Governor of Fort St George in Madras, for a very high price. The diamond weighed 426 carats before it was shipped to England in 1702 to be cut. This operation took two years, from 1704 to 1706, and produced several secondary stones, which were sold to Tsar Peter the Great. Performed by a jeweler by the name of Harris, this cut is the culmination of a technique possibly invented in Venice in the early seventeenth century: the brilliant cut. In this process, the angles, formed by the facets, are of a perfect cut, reflecting the light with matchless intensity and brilliance.

	The acquisition of the diamond by Philippe d'Orléans

	Taking advantage of the economic prosperity that developed in France under the influence of John Law, Philippe d'Orléans, regent from 1715 to 1723, persuaded the Regency Council to purchase the diamond on 6 June 1717. At the time, The Regent outshone all known diamonds in the western world, and by 1719 it had already tripled in value. Today, it is still considered the finest diamond in the world; its color is ""of the first water"", that is perfectly white and practically flawless. After the Regency, the gem remained one of the most precious of the Crown's treasures and adorned all the crowned heads of France.

	The ""Regent"" and the royal succession

The Regent was worn for the first time by Louis XV at the reception of a Turkish embassy in 1721. It was then mounted temporarily on the king's crown for his coronation ceremony on 25 October 1722. Shortly after his marriage to Maria Leczinska on 5 September 1725, Louis XV began wearing the diamond on his hat, a habit he continued throughout his reign. For the coronation of Louis XVI, on 11 June 1775, a new crown was made similar to that of Louis XV, featuring The Regent on the front. Like his grandfather, Louis XVI sported the gem on his hat. Stolen in 1792, then found again the following year hidden in some roof timbers, the diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat, before being permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801. The First Consul used it to embellish his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, the work of Nitot. Following changes in the ruling regime, the diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III, and finally on the Grecian diadem of Empress Eugénie.

A naked dwarf straddles a snail. The juxtaposition of a deformed figure and a monstrous snail is somewhat audacious and bears witness to the sixteenth-century taste for bizarre and unbalanced forms. The dwarf is reminiscent of garden sculptures made for villas; indeed, the Villa Careggi has a sculpture of the same subject. In the past this work has been attributed to many different artists, but it is now generally agreed that this bronze is a revealing work of Florentine mannerism.
The Dwarf
A naked dwarf sits astride, but unbalanced, the shell of a snail, holding the handle of a whip in his right hand. He seems to want to goad his strange mount to move more quickly. This statuette is identical to a marble statue in the gardens of the Villa Careggi in Florence. In the same Villa is another statue, of a dwarf straddling an owl; the bronze version of this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The two statues at the Villa Careggi are called 'Morgante' and 'Margutte'. Morgante (c.1535 - after 1595) was the dwarf of Cosimo de'Medici I and his successors; he was named after a fictional giant, 'Morgante Maggiore', who was a character in an epic poem by Luigi Pulci published in Florence in 1481. Between 1560 and 1600, many depictions of dwarves were produced at the Florentine court, because of the level of curiosity provoked by Morgante.
The Attributions
Representations of dwarves and putti were very fashionable before the 1560s as part of the decoration of fountains in Florence, or as ornament in frescoes in a number of palaces (for example, in the Camera Picta of the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua). Because of this, the Louvre bronze was attributed successively to Tullio Lombardo, Francesco Colla, the Paduan School, and finally to Valerio Cioli. This last attribution is probably the most secure, because Cioli was the sculptor of the two marble statues at the Villa Careggi. We know that Cioli travelled to Carrara in 1599 to acquire the marble for four statues, two of which were to be of dwarves. However, he was dead by the end of the year, and as a result the sculptures were completed by Valerio's nephew, Simone Cioli, after his uncle's models. The workmanship of the bronze statuette is much better than that of the marble sculpture, which leads one to suppose that the former is earlier than the latter, and that it was made by Valerio Cioli himself.
Technique and Style
This dwarf on his snail was cast in bronze by the lost-wax method, and the hair and the body have been gone over with a graver after casting. The statuette is covered in a black patina that is now crazed; this was probably the 'oil patina' Vasari describes in his writings, the oil having been coloured with smoke black to give it this dark hue. The bronze-maker's workmanship is very sensitive, playing with light/dark effects and accentuating the roundness of certain forms as well as movement. This work can be seen as part of the developing trend towards naturalism in small bronzes of the mannerist period, because of the imbalance in the composition and the strong modelling of the gastropod and the dwarf.

With its bell-shaped body and cylindrical neck topped with two perforated circles, this strange object was long known as the ""eye idol"" or ""idol with spectacles."" Such idols date from the Late Uruk period (3300-3000 BC) and are found mainly in northern Mesopotamia and Syria. They were first thought to be votive objects, but may have been used in spinning.
An eye idol?
This relatively large pottery object has a bell-shaped body and a cylindrical neck topped by two perforated circles. Its flat base shows that it was meant to be freestanding. The beige clay is covered with a thick orange-red slip, which is still shiny under the concretions. Max Mallowan coined the conventional name of ""eye idols"" in 1937-38 during excavations at Tell Brak in Syria, where hundreds of small anthropomorphic plaques with huge eyes were found in a richly decorated building. The archaeologist extended the name to other objects, this time called ""idols with spectacles"" because they were surmounted by two circles that were disproportionately large compared with the total size of the object. They were regarded as prototypes of the first objects found. The building in which they were found was called the ""Temple of the Eyes"" because of its rich decor of cone mosaics and gold plating, as well as for the eye idols that were unearthed there. However, the building was altered several times and remains stratigraphically unreliable. There is nothing to prove that it had a religious function. 
A multitude of eye idols
Eye idols are scattered over a vast region bounded by southeast Turkey (Arslantepe) to the north, Syria (Hama) to the west, and southern Mesopotamia (Telloh, Uruk, Ur) and Iranian Khuzistan (Susa) to the south. These objects are characteristic of the Proto-urban period in Uruk (3700-3100 BC) during which the first cities appeared. The many different contexts in which they were discovered (domestic, ritual, funerary, dumps) cast doubt on the strictly religious function of these objects, which vary greatly in shape, material, and style.In 1996, Catherine Bréniquet suggested dividing the idols into three types. Type 1, from Tell Brak, known as ""eye idols,"" covers all the small engraved alabaster plaques evoking the upper part of a human body with the face reduced to the eyes and sometimes adorned with jewelry and headdresses. Type 2, the ""large idols with spectacles,"" covers quite large bell- or trumpet-shaped pottery objects with a neck supporting two perforated circles. Some have been carefully shaped, smoothed and glazed, while others are quite summarily made. Our idol belongs to this type of ""large idols with spectacles,"" present in northern Mesopotamia and Syria. Type 3, which groups ""small idols with spectacles"" shows strong similarities with Type 2, but these objects are much smaller and are all made of stone.
Various interpretations
Max Mallowan interpreted all these objects as belonging to one and the same series, evolving in shape over time. The group would have made a set of votive objects dedicated to an ""eye god"" venerated in the ""temple"" of Tell Brak. Other scholars have thought Types 2 and 3 to be lids (H. Frankfort), a set of standard weights or weights for a loom, or even firedogs to be set around a hearth. Catherine Bréniquet believes that Type 1 models - the only ones that really deserve to be called ""eye idols"" - should be distinguished from Types 2 and 3. The latter could well be instruments used in spinning, placed in front of the seated operator. The holes were used to separate two or three single threads, which were then twisted together.  On cylinder seals from the Uruk period, such objects seem to be shown in association with spinners at work.

Foundation deposits, such as these models of building tools, were buried prior to the construction of a temple or royal tomb—and sometimes of a fortress, palace, or city. Samples of materials used (bricks, stones) and miniature tools (axes, hoes, etc) commemorated the construction work, while vases evoked the food offerings required by the cult. The materials varied over the years.
A royal ceremony
The foundation of temples, tombs, and certain important buildings was accompanied by a ceremony, presided over by the king, during which the plan of the future building was traced on the ground, the temple's orientation having been determined by astronomical sightings. During this celebration, objects and offerings were buried at the site of the future walls and floors, very often in the corners. The ceremony was held under the patronage of Seshat, goddess of knowledge and writing; images of the event show her ""stretching the cord"" with the king.
A wide range of buried objects
The objects that were buried under the foundations were representative of ordinary or precious materials (brick, faience, copper), building tools (axes, adzes), and ceremonial tools (stakes, mallets, hoes). They also included a large number of recipients, offerings, and skins of sacrificed animals. Finally, there were amulets, commemorative scarabs, and ritual objects. The type of flat adze that is represented here was probably not a tool; it resembles the object that was held to the mummy's face to reanimate it (the ritual ""opening of the mouth""), and doubtless had a symbolic function: we know of the existence of a ritual ""opening of the mouth"" of the temple, which likened the building to an inert being that needed bringing to life. The foundation deposits discovered in the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri are among the richest and most beautiful that have come down to us. Although all the objects presented here come from the queen's temple, they did not necessarily belong to the same original set. 
Small wooden sleds have intrigued Egyptologists; they are generally supposed to be models of contraptions that were used to haul and tip blocks of stone. However, it is worth noting that such items have never been found elsewhere than in the foundation deposits of Deir el-Bahri.
The royal dedicatees
All the objects seen here bear one or more inscriptions which give, in various forms, the names of the royal dedicatees, of the building, and of the main god of the temple. They are engraved or traced in black ink. The plaques bear the simple formula: ""The perfect god Maatkare given life, stability, and power"" (Hatshepsut), and ""The perfect god Menkheperre given life, stability, and power"" (Tuthmosis III). 
Hatshepsut served as regent for her young nephew Tuthmosis, and despite being pretender to the throne had therefore to associate him with her official acts. A more elaborate formula—""The perfect god Maatkare, beloved of Amun who reigns in Djeser-djeseru""—signifies that the temple of Deir el-Bahri (called the ""Holy of Holies"") was dedicated to Amun, the god of Thebes, by Queen Hatshepsut.

The candid gesture may be an allusion to Gabrielle's pregnancy and the birth in 1594 of César de Vendôme, the illegitimate son of Henry IV. 
Italian influence
Although very much in the style of the second school of Fontainebleau, this work remains anonymous. It shows the influence of Italian Renaissance art in the sensual contours of the bodies of the two young women, but also contains references to Flemish art, such as the intimacy of the background scene. 
The trompe-l'oeil technique
The artist has made skillful use of the trompe-l'oeil technique, using an imitative, realistic style for on the sheet in the bath and the two curtains framing the scene. The trompe-l'oeil effect is accentuated by the view of what is taking place in the background room. Richly colored, unsettling in its presentation of two women in their bath, and mysterious in its use of symbol - the ring being shown by Gabrielle d'Estrées, for example - the sensuality of the painting made it a popular success. Sensuous yet marvelously delicate, the contours of the two naked bodies are highlighted by the lighting of the two women from the left and the contrast with the shadowy background. 
An oddly affectionate gesture
The models have been identified as Gabrielle d'Estrées (1571-99), the favorite of Henry IV (1553-1610), and one of her sisters: the Duchess de Villars or Madame de Balagny. The oddly affectionate way in which the sister is pinching Gabrielle d'Estrées' right breast has often been taken as symbolizing the latter's pregnancy with the illegitimate child of Henry IV. This interpretation would seem to be confirmed by the scene of the young woman sewing - perhaps preparing a layette for the coming child - in the background. The picture was acquired by the Louvre in 1937.

This exceptionally large fragmentary head is one of the first and finest examples of the type of Greek marble sculpture that flourished in the Cyclades in the Early Bronze Age. The typical ""Cycladic idol"" takes the form of a naked female standing on the tips of her toes, her arms crossed over her breasts. Despite the many statuettes that have been found, their iconography and function remain a mystery.
Marble idols
The spread of bronze metalworking began in 3200 BC and passed through the Anatolian province of Cyprus before reaching the shores of the Aegean Sea and its many islands. This brought an end to the Neolithic period, or Stone Age. Paradoxically, however, it was in the Early Bronze Age - i.e., during the third millennium BC-that the first masterpieces of Greek marble sculpture were produced: polished marble ""idols."" This art form spread throughout the archipelago of the Cyclades (from the Greek word kuklos, meaning circle), centered around the island of Delos. Because of its perfection and exceptional size, this head from the island of Keros is one of the most important examples of this art form. The statue, which was originally about 1.5 meters tall, depicts a naked female standing on the tips of her toes, her legs joined, and her arms crossed over her breasts.
A mysterious significance
We do not really know what these figurines-incorrectly called ""idols""-signified or their function or how they were originally presented. A number of hypotheses have been advanced and subsequently disproved. Some resemble mother figures, similar to Near Eastern goddesses of fertility. Others have been interpreted as images of the deceased, female protectors of the dead, or servants for the afterlife. They were not, however, exclusively used in funerary contexts, since they have been found in both burial and habitation sites and sometimes show traces of ancient repairs.
A geometric sketch
Pumice stone was used to polish the marble (two materials that are quite common in this region of Greece). The balance and compositional purity of the lyre-shaped head is striking. Polychrome was used to indicate the eyes, mouth, and for any facial markings, thereby highlighting the brilliant whiteness of the stone. This seemingly simple work is the result of a harmonious combination of volumes and smooth surfaces. Only the ears, invisible from the front, and the nose are indicated in light relief. They bring life to this face made of sensuous lines and curves, which were probably created with some sort of compass. The piece is a veritable geometric sketch, and the heightened sense of abstraction offered by such art stimulated the imaginations of many twentieth-century artists, including Brancusi, Modigliani, and Picasso.

This Illyrian-style helmet is characterized by the absence of a nasal, a quadrangular cut-out around the face, and fixed cheek plates. It was found in a male burial site in northern Greece and dates from the middle of the fifth century BC. Discovered nearby was a small, diamond-shaped strip of gold which covered the mouth of the deceased in accordance with a funeral rite, evidence for which has been unearthed by recent excavations in the Macedonian necropolis of Sindos.

	Part of the funerary trappings of a male tomb

	In the course of the year 1917, the Service Archéologique de l'Armée d'Orient unearthed several burial sites at Stavroupolis (the Turkish name for which is Zeitenlik) in northern Greece. This Illyrian-style bronze helmet was among the funeral trappings discovered in the stone sarcophagus of a warrior. The Macedonian tomb, which dates from the middle of the fifth century BC, was not buried deep, and inside it was found the skeleton of a man wearing this helmet on his head, with a spear on his left side and a sword over his abdomen. A small strip of gold, a silver ring, the curved blade of an iron cutlass, and various terra-cotta vases - a goblet, a lekythos, a skyphos, and an exaleiptron - were also buried with the deceased and are now in the Museum of Salonika and the Louvre.

	An Illyrian-style helmet

	Particularly favored in northern Greece, the Illyrian-style helmet owes its name to ancient Illyria, a province situated in the northern part of the Balkans. It is characterized by the absence of a nasal, a quadrangular cut-out around the face, fixed cheek plates, and the demarcation of a wide central area, running along the middle of the crown, to which the crest was attached. The crown of the helmet is made up of a single sheet of metal, decorated at the edge with a delicate pattern of raised dots and two lines in relief. At a later stage of development, the cheek plates became more elongated and were placed vertically in relation to the back part of the crown. The transition, as that stage, was marked by a deep angular notch.

	Macedonian funerary rites

	Recent excavations carried out at the necropolis of Sindos in Macedonia have confirmed the existence of distinctive funeral practices; it would seem that the disposition of the bodies and the funerary trappings were subject to very strict rules. The pieces of armor were placed on the remains according to a custom observed in most of the tombs in the region: the spear on the left and the sword level with the chest, its tip pointing outward and to the left. As for the vases, they were arranged between the legs, according to custom. The diamond-shaped gold strip shown with the helmet was attached to the mouth of the deceased by a thong going round the back of the head. In the richest burial sites, the whole or part of the face was covered with gold leaf. The helmet might also be decorated with gold bands above the brow and along the vertical edges of the cheek plates.

This small male figurine carved from hippopotamus ivory comes from Safadi, in the Negev, Israel. It is a fine illustration of the work of ivory carvers around 3500 BC. The naturalistic style and rather stiff pose are characteristic of many male or female nude statues of the time. Their role may be religious or related to fertility.
Hidden in the floor of an underground dwelling
Uncovered in 1958 by Jean Perrot during the eighth campaign of excavations at Beersheba, this figurine carved from hippopotamus ivory was found in the floor of an underground house, perhaps an ivory workshop. The statuette seems to have been made on the spot, because tools were found there, too: a slab of limestone as a work bench, a bone handle fitted with a copper tip, and a perforated hematite mallet that may have been used to work a drill. 
An original art form
The man is represented in a frontal position, naked or wearing a simple loincloth with a penis sheath, and standing in a hieratic pose. His ovoid head seems to be sunken into his shoulders. His ears are delicate and close to the head. His round, hollow eyes were probably inset with a bead to imitate the iris. A long straight nose divides the face in two. The mouth and chin are almost absent. A slight hollow on the top of the skull suggests that it once held a wig; other statuettes discovered at the same time have small holes for attaching beards and other attributes to accentuate the presence of facial and sometimes body hair. The body is slender with angular, narrow shoulders. The thin arms are separated from the body and touch it at the hips. From a technical point of view, they were separated by a series of holes probably bored with a copper pin like the one found beside the statuette. The hands are sharply bent onto the pelvis, which accentuates the impression of stiffness. The figure is wearing a penis sheath and a loincloth that poorly conceals his prominent penis, further emphasized by incisions in the ivory. His short legs have been separated by sawing the ivory with a flint tool; the feet are rudimentary. 
A naturalistic style
This work is a fine illustration of the naturalistic style of many statuettes produced in the region during the Chalcolithic Age. Stylistically, they are similar to the statuettes produced in Predynastic Egypt, especially in the Naqadah period around 3500 BC. Other figurines have been found from the same period and their role may have be religious or related to ideas about fertility.

Upon completion of their military service, Roman soldiers received a diploma in the name of the emperor, in the form of an engraved bronze plaque stating the names of the beneficiaries, and the privileges granted. The present plaque was given in AD 139 to a foot-soldier named Gaius, in the second cohort of Galatians, commanded by Q. Flavius Amatianus. It tells us a great deal about the composition of the Roman army in Palestine, its command structure and the status of the soldiers.
A reward for Roman army veterans
Until the third century AD, it was customary for the emperor to reward his soldiers when they had completed their military service, after a period of twenty-five years. On these occasions, a bronze ""master tablet"" was produced, stating the names of the soldiers concerned, and the privileges granted to them. Each soldier could then ask to receive a copy known as a military diploma, inscribed with his name alone. The present example comes from Syria, and was found in Afiq (now Fiq), near the Sea of Galilee. The diplomas were generally made up of two rectangular bronze tablets joined by a cord threaded through two holes pierced on either side, and soldered with pewter. One of the tablets was engraved with the text of the law as announced on the master tablet, while the other bore the names of seven Roman citizens, certified by wax seals that have since been lost, endorsing the accuracy and authenticity of the copy.
Standard content
With the exception of the name of the recipient, which personalizes the text, these military diplomas are administrative documents whose content and headings are, for the most part, identical. The name of the emperor and his titulature appear at the top, followed by the name of the army unit concerned, details of where it was stationed and the name of its commander. Next comes a description of the good and loyal services of the veterans, and the privileges granted to them, together with the date and the names of the recipient of the diploma and members of his family designated to share the privileges. The inscription ends with the names of the witnesses and a description of the public place where the original text was displayed: Rome, on the south-east side of the Forum, on the wall of the temple to the divine Augustus, near a sanctuary to Minerva.
The military diploma of Gaius
The present diploma was issued during the reign of the Emperor Antoninus, in AD 139, to a foot-soldier named Gaius. Gaius was originally from Nicaea (present-day Iznik, Turkey), and served in the second Ulpian cohort of Galatians, commanded by Q. Flavius Amatianus. The text of the law inscribed on the exterior face of one of the plaques is an incomparable source of information about the organization of the Roman army, its command structure and the social status of the soldiers. It gives the composition of the auxiliary troops (three cavalry wings and twelve cohorts) incorporated into the Palestinian army after the Barkokeba revolt and the severe repression that followed it, soon after AD 132. The inner faces of the diploma are rapidly engraved with the same text; certain words are abbreviated (although not in accordance with the usual rules), sentences have been partly omitted, and the names of the troop corps often truncated. In accordance with tradition, the privileges granted to Gaius and his descendants were the right to legally-recognized marriage (""conubium"") and Roman citizenship.

This model liver is one of 32 such livers found in Room 108 of the palace at Mari. In Mesopotamia, the liver was believed to be the essential organ of thought and feeling. Diviners predicted the future by the examination of viscera. Malformations or abnormalities of the liver are illustrated on the model, and inscriptions give the associated predictions. These model livers may have served as aide-mémoire for priests or been used in the training of diviners.
Ancient divination
In the course of Parrot's excavations at Mari in 1935-36, 32 inscribed clay livers were discovered among the tablets found in Room 108 of the palace. This piece comes from that group, which offers the earliest direct evidence of hepatoscopy (the examination of the liver of a sacrificed sheep), one of the branches of ancient divination. A practice proper to Mesopotamia, the art of divination produced a considerable body of specialized literature: haruspicy, the observation of animal entrails, and astrology, a later development, were the two most important forms. Dreams and birth abnormalities were also interpreted to yield predictions. Hepatoscopy developed in the early second millennium BC and became increasingly important. Although it is attested in the pre-Sargonic period (third millennium BC), the Mari livers are nonetheless the oldest known representations of omens.
Hepatoscopy
The role of the liver in the organism had attracted the attention of the ancients; in Mesopotamia it was believed to have been an essential organ, the seat of thought and feeling. The priests who examined the livers of a sacrificial sheep or kid had two kinds of document at their disposal: lists of predictions and the clay livers. Copied and recopied since earliest Antiquity, the lists rehearsed the predictions associated with changes in the liver phrased as: ""If such a part of the liver shows such an anomaly, then such a thing will happen."" Anomalies could be associated with a historical event they were believed to have predicted in the past, allowing the diviner to draw conclusions regarding the future. There was thus a list of ""model events"" warranting the truthfulness of predictions, well-known to the priests because they were recalled on the clay model with phrases such as: ""prediction of (king) so-and-so."" The liver models showed the alterations, and indicated the corresponding predictions. They would thus have acted as aide-mémoire to the specialist diviners, or may have been used in schools of augury.
Divination and royal power
This type of divination was rarely performed for ordinary people, being more often concerned with the destiny of kings and states. The Mari archives clearly demonstrate the importance of augury in the exercise of power: the king regularly consulted the augurs before acting. The foundation rites for towns and official buildings included the taking of auguries, and the same was done when a prince thought of destroying an enemy city. This model liver thus includes an ""augury concerning the destruction of small towns"" (three-line inscription on one side), ""if a prince has gone out to the mountain or the plain..."" (two lines on the reverse).

The mummy label is an emblematic funerary object from the Roman era in Egypt. Attached to the mummy, it was the deceased's identification and passport to eternity. A portrait of the deceased, with an epitaph in Greek, was depicted on one side, while a standard prayer formula in demotic script graced the other.
A Portrait of the Deceased
This exceptionally large label is rectangular in shape and slightly curved on the side. It has a hole in it, through which a linen tie was threaded to attach it to the mummy.The reverse side has a frontal view of the deceased, and the small curved side reproduces the upper rounded section of a stele. The deceased is wearing a red tunic adorned with two dark bands, and the sleeves are trimmed with a braid of the same color. She is wearing shoes on her splayed feet. Her thin neck supports an enormous head, which is disproportionately large for the body. Two immense eyes fill the triangular face; the thick eyebrows meet above the bridge of the broad nose, which joins the tiny mouth. Three bead pendants hang from her ears. Black lines arranged around her curly hair form a schematic design of an Osiris crown of justification. To the right of the deceased is an altar of horns for incense offerings. Below is an inscription in Greek: ""Artemis, daughter of Anaraus, whose mother is Tronchonminis, lived to the age of twenty-one years.""A Roman tabula-ansata-type label is drawn on the front side, while the unused space has been hatched with lines. This imitation label carries a formula in demotic script reading: ""May her soul live with Osiris Sokaris, the great god, master of the West, Tamin, daughter of Anarau, whose mother is Tronchonmin, dead in her twenty-first year. May her soul live forever.""

Keeping Identity after Death
The imagery on the reverse side was inspired by Ptolemaic funerary steles. Yet the deceased here, shown in a frontal pose, suggests the idea of renaissance and awakening. The importance given to the face, especially the oversized eyes, means that the preservation of the head, linked to that of the name, was of primordial concern, as they reflected her identity and her individuality.The simultaneous use of Greek and demotic script can be explained by the fact that Greek became the official language once the Ptolemaic kings took power. Yet the Egyptians continued to speak and write their own language, known as ""popular"" demotic, which developed in the late sixth century BC. It was to die out only in the early fifth century AD.The use of the wooden label as a means of identification dates from the New Kingdom. During the Roman period, the mummy label was well suited to the mass burials, density and stacking of bodies that characterized the funerary practices of the time.

A Label-Stele
This miniature portable stele was a less expensive replacement for the cumbersome stone monument. The short prayer formula was equally efficient and functioned as a Book for the Coming Forth by Day or the Second Book of Breathing. Given that the priority was to perpetuate the name of the deceased, the majority of the labels were written simply.This funerary object probably came from one of the necropolises situated on the western bank of the Nile in the region of Akhmim, formerly Panopolis, in Upper Egypt.

The relatively large numbers of human representations from the late predynastic period in Egypt are not always highly detailed or very realistic, and we do not know their purpose. They were discovered in tombs, when the origin is known with certainty. This male statuette is an exceptional example, due to its size and refined execution; it was dated by comparing it to another extremely similar work.
A spectacular figure
This ivory sculpture is nearly 25 centimeters high. The man is standing, nude, and has an erection. His arms, now broken off, must have hung straight against the body. The legs are straight and stop at the ankles; the feet were never sculpted. The small head is round and clean-shaven, and the face is very flat; it narrows down to a pointed chin, probably to evoke a beard. The large round eyes were inlaid with a piece of ivory or bone; the pupil in the middle was indicated by a hole (the inlay of the left eye has fallen out). Delicate ivory dowels at the ears indicate that these elements were made separately and attached to the statuette. The body is long and elegant, with simplified forms.
The beginnings of statuary
Human figures, made of clay and especially ivory, became fairly common by the late predynastic period. Indeed, we know of an entire series of ivory tusks that are engraved to varying degrees with male or female features. Sculptures in the round are more unusual, but a half-dozen nude male statuettes have been identified recently. Like the Louvre statuette, most come from the art market and can therefore not be used as a basis of comparison for dating other works. But one of them, located in the Cairo Museum, was discovered during excavations at a well-documented cemetery.
This man is nearly 6,000 years old
The statuette in the Cairo Museum, extremely similar to the Louvre piece, is even taller (35 cm). The position of the man is the same, but he is wearing a penis sheath, a common accessory in Egypt and the Middle East in the fourth millennium BC. It has the same inlaid eyes, rounded, clean-shaven head, and long, slender body. The shape of the beard is different, but the two figures are so similar that these statuettes must have been fairly contemporaneous. The Cairo statuette comes from the richest tomb in the Mahasna cemetery (some fifteen kilometers downstream from Abydos), which contained the skeletons of a man and a woman. It has been accurately dated, via the ceramic, from the Naqada I period, to between 4000 and 3700 BC.

The distinctive feature of these small, decorative, turned wood urns is that they hide the profiles of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The two images are not immediately visible, but appear through an optical effect between the lower belly and upper base of each piece.
Urn-shaped vases
The form of these elegant, seemingly identical ornamental vases was inspired by architecture. Each small, ovoid urn stands on a high base resembling the shaft of a column, and is made of finely turned mahogany decorated with gilded bronze. A small chain on the column is held in place by four rings, and the vase is embellished with three rows of beads and two buttons in the place of handles. At the top of each urn is a fixed lid, topped by a bronze pine cone.
Seditious objects
The superb quality of the turning should not distract from the hidden feature of these vases: though innocuous at first glance, they actually hide the profiles of the king and queen which stand out in negative silhouette in the contours of the urns. Their shape, which closely resembles a type of funerary urn, indicates that they were made after 1793—the year of the death of both Louis XVI (January 21) and Marie Antoinette (October 16). 
These items were no doubt commissioned by royalists; they were a means of evoking the royal family, and of paying tribute to a pre-revolutionary age without fear of reprisals. ""Seditious"" engravings were also made, in which figures were hidden.

These flowers and corymbs, gilded or painted in different colors, were originally parts of a shimmering wreath. Made of clay, the wreath imitated a wreath of flowers adorned with precious metal, but was more durable and less costly. While such wreaths were worn for civic or religious ceremonies, this imitation, found in a necropolis at Cyrenaica, would have been for funerary use, in accordance with the attested practices of the Hellenistic period.
Terra-cotta jewelry
These flowers and corymbs were likely elements of a wreath whose supporting structure has not survived. The structure would probably have been of bronze, as is suggested by the remains of the fastenings visible behind the surviving parts. The daisies, violets, and ivy inflorescences are naturalistically modeled in clay. The various colors (violet, pink, red, green) and motifs (lines, dots, etc.) lend verisimilitude while at the same time producing a richly decorative effect, which is further reinforced by the gilding.
A funerary wreath
Terra-cotta, a humble material, was used to make jewelry that when gilded could rival gold jewelry in appearance. But this clay wreath could also confer symbolic immortality on natural elements by rendering them in imperishable form. It could thus have a role in a funerary context.While in the classical age the wreath of leaves or gold became the symbol of political distinction and of military and civil honors, as well as the prize in athletic competition, it also figured in everyday life, at weddings and banquets, and as an offering to the gods. Wreaths were also used in funerary contexts and bore the same honorific significance. They adorned the deceased or the urn containing the ashes, and might also served as a simple offerings.
A widespread practice
This type of imitation jewelry can be found as far afield as Macedonia, Southern Italy, and Egypt around 330-300 BC, a time when a common artistic language was emerging in the Mediterranean basin. This wreath was found in Cyrenaica (the eastern part of present-day Libya), where the Greeks had been present since the foundation of the city of Cyrene in 631 BC. The necropolises there have yielded several terra-cotta figurines, well represented in the Louvre's collections, especially those assembled by Vattier de Bourville in the mid-19th century.

This perforated stone was commissioned by Puzur-Inshushinak, a prince of the dynasty of Awan in Iran, to commemorate the erection of a monument. It is decorated in relief with a scene showing a god offering a nail before a lion, protected by a lama divinity. The object, which displays a strong Mesopotamian influence, also has two inscriptions, one in Elamite, the other in Akkadian.
A commemorative stone for the foundation of a building
This stone seems to be part of an object made in three sections. It has a central perforation, some fifteen centimeters in diameter, intended to receive a nail made of copper and cedarwood. This hole would would have been made with a wooden or metal tool, with grains of quartz used as an abrasive. This was a votive stone dedicated as part of the foundation ritual for a building. A second fragmentary  relief (Sb 177) shows the hindquarters of a lion and carries an inscription in Akkadian. The broken surfaces seem both to belong to the left side of the same object, although the exact correspondence has not been established. This stone was commissioned by Puzur-Inshushak, a king of the Awan dynasty, after the decline of the Akkadian Empire, c.2100 BC.
A mythological scene illustrating the function of the monument
The mythological scene is carved in bas-relief on the side of the stone. A god, wearing a short loincloth and a horned headdress, presents a monumental nail before a crouching lion. The god is on his knees, in an attitude expressive of the effort involved in driving in a nail, and is protected by the Lama standing behind him. This minor goddess, characteristic of the Sumerian renaissance that followed the fall of the Akkadian Empire (2350-2150 BC), is a beneficent power. Generally nameless, she has a protective role. Here she stands behind the god who performs the foundation ritual. She is depicted in an attitude of intercession that is found unchanged until the Neo-Babylonian Period (626-539 BC): standing, with forearms raised to the level of her face. The wild beast embodies either the evil forces which the god must ward off or, conversely, a guard animal defending the entrance to the sanctuary. Despite Puzur-Inshushak's battle for independence, the iconography still displays a strong Mesopotamian influence. The coiled snake on the upper part of the stone was a popular motif in Iran, here wound around the central perforation.
Two different writing systems
The stone has an Elamite inscription in a new script, linear Elamite, which is however incomplete. The new script was meant to express the language of the mountain-dwellers of Northern Iran, symbolizing the rebirth of Elam as a center of political power. The second fragment has a fragmentary text in Akkadian, in a cuneiform script of Sumerian origin. The presence of both Akkadian and Elamite inscriptions is characteristic of the official monuments of the reign of Puzur-Inshushinak, who reconstructed a state that included the land of Susa, which spoke a Semitic language, and the Iranian plateau, which spoke Elamite. The Akkadian inscription on the back of the lion would have consisted of two columns.

Dated 1503, this is one of the earliest extant drawings clearly attributable to Baldung. It was probably executed at the beginning of the artist's Nuremberg period, when he joined the studio of Albrecht Dürer. The story of the philosopher enslaved by a woman was a popular fable in the Middle Ages, often represented in miniatures and ivories. The drawing is particularly interesting for the zealous realism of its notation and the broad, freely-executed landscape.
The triumph of seduction over intellect
This satirical scene, presented in a pseudo-realistic landscape, shows the beautiful courtesan Phyllis in contemporary dress, riding side-saddle on the back of the great philosopher. Grovelling abjectly on all fours, Aristotle is kept on a tight rein and threatened with a riding crop. To the left rise the crenellated walls and towers of a German town. The story has its origins in the writings of the thirteenth-century scholar Jacques de Vitry. Popular throughout the Rhineland, the fable was the subject of the fifteenth-century comedy Ain Spil van Maister Aristotiles, whose origins can be traced to the region extending from the Upper Rhine to Bavaria. In the sixteenth century it was popular as an illustration of the triumph of female seduction over masculine intellect. Baldung's version is in the latter tradition and clearly reflects the artist's taste for burlesque mockery.
A confident young draftsman
The picture's boldly conceived composition fixes the viewer's attention on the figures, drawn with evident delectation on the part of the artist. The confident, measured line relates to Dürer's graphic style of the period 1494-1500, although Baldung's characteristically curvilinear, undulating notation is already evident. Baldung outlines the contours, organizes the circular arrangement of folds of Phyllis's skirt, and uses zones of cross-hatching to emphasize volume. Another of his early drawings, Landscape with Saint Catherine, circa 1504-6 (Basel, Kupferstichkabinett), is based on a similar compositional structure: a central figure or group, a view opening onto a fortress to the left, and to the right, behind a group of trees, a quickly-sketched horizon in the calligraphic style typical of Baldung's drawings and engravings of the period.
Nuremberg and Dürer
The present picture is important in the context of Baldung's drawings as a whole. Though unsigned, it is accepted as one of his earliest surviving sketches, along with two others: Death and the Landsknecht in Modena (Galleria Estense) and the Virgin and Child on a crescent moon in the Schilling Collection, in London. Dated 1503, the drawing may have been executed before Baldung began working in Dürer's studio (in the same year), although the style suggests that the young artist was already familiar with Dürer's work. Baldung's individual style is apparent in the play of cross-hatching and the sensual, opulent pose and treatment of the female figure. He returned to the same subject in a woodcut executed ten years later: free from the influence of Dürer, Baldung depicts himself as a witness to the spectacle, emphasizing his highly personal, ironic vision.

This colorful, illustrated piece of fabric probably once adorned a tunic. Despite the schematic and awkward quality of the weaving, the theme of Aphrodite's marriage to the handsome hunter Adonis is recognizable. It is interesting to note that pagan traditions were still prevalent throughout Christian Egypt, as illustrated through the ironic eye of this weaver. 
Popular images
Aphrodite is standing and twisting her hair in a minimalist landscape, represented by a spindly tree with two leaves and a feline in an odd pose. This gesture refers to the day of her birth, when she emerged dripping wet from the sea. She reveals her charms to a hunter leaning languidly on his spear. Aphrodite's famous girdle, described by Homer, has become merely a long straight scarf draped from her arm to her legs, passing inelegantly between her thighs, and then rising up to her right elbow. Her right hand is waving a flower meant to be a rose. The altar near the goddess, from which rises a simplified design of fire, symbolizes the altar of marriages. The spouse is most likely Adonis, son of Myrrha, who was transformed into a tree (the myrrh tree), in punishment for her involuntary incest. Adonis was a skilled hunter; he is armed with a spear and barely visible bow, and is accompanied by his dog. This Coptic image is interesting when compared to a 6th-century silver Byzantine prototype of this same scene.
Faith or fidelity?
Who wore such a pagan image three or four centuries after Christianity had taken hold? Who dared to show a scene from the love life of the goddess of Love and Fertility, when the early church patriarchs were so ferociously opposed to paganism?The existence of such mystery cults as Dionysius, Isis and even Mithras at this late date is still uncertain, but we do know that there were sporadic pockets of pagan resistance throughout the entire Empire. The persistence of Aphrodite's cult of fertility does not seem very credible in a society wealthy enough to produce high-quality clothing and cultivated enough to know the ancient Greek myths.These images were kept alive by the weight of tradition and the popularity of the adventures of the Greek gods, which were illustrated both in the decorative arts and in texts, notably the theater (an example being the Metamorphoses by Apuleius, inspired from Ovid's Metamorphoses). They may have been somewhat controversial, but no longer expressed their original meaning.

As a pendant to The Adoration of the Shepherds, “by a bizarre contrast” Fragonard painted a picture “free and full of passion” (Lenoir, 1816), showing profane as opposed to sacred love. Its porcelain-like light effects illustrate the evolution of his work after he returned from his second trip to Italy in 1774.
The Bolt and its pendant, The Adoration of the Shepherds
The composition of The Bolt appeared for the first time in a drawing by Fragonard auctioned in 1777 and popularized by Blot’s 1784 engraving. The picture acquired by the Louvre in 1974 was therefore painted between these two dates. It was commissioned by the Marquis de Véri, as a pendant to The Adoration of the Shepherds (RF 1988-11), but the two works separated at the auction after his death in 1785, and were not reunited until The Adoration of the Shepherds was donated to the Louvre in 1988. The only thing the pictures have in common is their format and color range, yet their strange contrast was not merely the result of some painterly whim.
A hidden meaning?
At first sight, The Bolt is just another of the many amorous scenes Fragonard painted. A woman is half-heartedly fending off her lover’s advances. But looking closer, one notices intriguing details. Why is the man bolting the door if the room is already in a disarray indicating what is to come? In this light, certain objects unveil their erotic symbolism: the knocked-over chair (legs in the air), the vase and roses (allusions to the female genitals), the bolt (male genitals), and especially the bed, taking up most of the left of the composition. Its anthropomorphic forms make it the scene’s principal actor, and its manifest disorder embodies the protagonists’ sexual urges.
Beyond this, opinions differ. D. Arasse considers The Bolt and The Adoration to be complementary illustrations of the power of love and desire in their human, spiritual and physical dimensions. For J. Thuillier, on the other hand, the two pictures contrast profane and sacred love, sin and redemption. The Bolt symbolizes Eve’s temptation (in which case the apple on the table is charged with meaning) which, in Christian tradition is sometimes associated with the Nativity.
A sign of an artistic evolution
A simple genre scene in the saucy spirit of the Louis XVI period, or a moralist history painting? The Bolt deliberately upsets the hierarchy of genres. Whatever meaning we ascribe it, the picture breaks with Fragonard’s previous work. He painted it after 1774 and the second stay in Italy which revitalized his inspiration. Having been refused a prestigious commission by Countess du Barry, Fragonard wanted to show his ability to adapt to evolutions in taste and the emergence of the Neoclassical style of Vien (see Inv 8431) and Pierre. In this purified composition, he reinterprets Dutch art, particularly that of Rembrandt. His smoother, more faience-like treatment, reduced palette and forms softened by the use of sfumato yet powerfully modeled in chiaroscuro, imbue his late works with a new poetry and gravity.

A pen and brown ink drawing of the Trojan horse, a theme from Virgil's Aeneid, this work is no doubt one of Girodet's most astonishing sheets because of its vigor and verve. Pen drawing is in fact the real subject of the drawing, vibrant with energy; in it, Girodet gave new impetus to line drawing.
Hidden intruders
This drawing in pen and brown ink shows the Greek invaders within the city of Troy, a scene recounted by Virgil in the Aeneid. The wooden horse built by Epeos (whose name is written on the animal's left leg) has been dragged into the city and the Greeks are starting to emerge from their hiding place. The last warriors are coming out of the horse's neck, marked with the Athenian owl to identify the attackers.
Classicism assumes a somber tone
Neoclassicism's favorite poet was Homer, who was very popular in the late 18th century. But about 1800, he was supplanted by Virgil, whose Collected Works were published by Didot in 1798. As illustrators, the publisher chose young artists recommended by David, including Girodet, who made a distinguished contribution to the work. In shifting from Homer to Virgil, from the Greek epic to the Latin poem, classicism assumed a more somber tone: the Aeneid is above all the saga of the defeated. This funereal liturgy, which was easy for people to identify with during the Revolution, is a stately dirge of sound and fury which culminates in the fall of Troy.
The violation of the palace
The artist shows the episode from the Trojans' point of view. He sets the scene between two strong columns decorated with trophies and linked with garlands (an allusion to the festive reception given to the horse). The architecture in the foreground, perhaps Priam's palace, which a Greek on a ladder is trying to break into, symbolically suggests the transgression of the threshold: the enemies have entered the impregnable city. Better still, the framework indicates a point of view, deliberately choosing the Trojan side. The scene is described from their ramparts. It is thus not by chance that the artist has depicted the dozing, useless guards, a pathetic metaphor of the destiny of the defeated. Girodet gives new impetus to line drawing: in his hand, line conveys life rather than an idea; it is the vector of movement used to render the turmoil of the scene and the feverishness of the attack. His capricious, twisting, mercurial line floods the page with energy, seeking less to illustrate than to translate the event, focusing on the effect rather than the idea.

Beneath the rings of the serpent that lies coiled around the top of the kudurru, the principal deities of the pantheon are represented in symbolic form. Below them is a cortege of animals and deities playing musical instruments. Walls and crenellated towers surround a space left blank for an inscription that was never carved. A horned serpent, symbol of the god Marduk, is coiled round the base.

	An anepigraphic kudurru

	This kudurru is one of a number of Mesopotamian works found in Susa. They were brought there by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte (late 12th century BC) as part of the spoils of his victorious campaigns in Mesopotamia. Kudurrus are characteristic of the Kassite Dynasty. They are decorated with bas-relief carvings, generally consisting of divine symbols and a text recording the details of royal gifts of land or privileges granted by the king to high-ranking dignitaries or members of his family. In this case, the decoration is divided into three registers, delineated at the top and base by two huge horned serpents. The lower register, where the text was to have been carved, is empty, although the surface was carefully prepared to receive the inscription: there are four polished zones demarcated by walls. Two of these zones are carved with horizontal lines ready for the cuneiform script.

	Divine symbols

	The word 'kudurru' is an Akkadian term meaning a boundary stone. However, contrary to what this name suggests, kudurrus were in fact stored in temples. Although they were primarily legal documents, their iconography provides a precious record of the religious life of the rulers who commissioned them. The upper register depicts the symbols associated with the principal deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon. Their order reflects the accepted hierarchy of the gods. The first triad consists of the three great deities: Anu, the sky god; Enlil, the earth god; and Ea, the god of Apsu, the body of fresh water on which the earth was believed to float. The second level represented the astral deities: Sin, the moon god, and his two children Shamash, the sun god, and Ishtar, the planet Venus. Immediately below them are the deities most in favor in the 2nd millennium BC. Marduk and his animal attribute - a horned dragon named Mushussu - are given pride of place, reflecting the theological desire to establish a universal god for Babylon, the capital of Mesopotamia. The iconographic style of this stele is very close to that of the kudurrus dating from the reign of King Melishihu (1186-1172 BC). This kudurru can thus be dated to the same period.

	An unusual procession

	While it was usual for kudurrus to be carved with a succession of divine symbols, in this case the carvings on the middle register are most unusual. They depict a procession of eight figures, all carrying bows and wearing the horned crowns that mark them out as gods. Seven of the figures are bearded gods, playing the lute and accompanied by animals. A goddess playing the tambourine and possibly dancing follows them. Although such friezes were very popular during the Kassite period, this composition is remarkable, even unique, in that it is most unusual to find two separate representations of the gods - one symbolic, one anthropomorphic - on the same monument. The ruler who commissioned the kudurru must have had a particular reason for including the procession as well as the more conventional symbolic representation. Unfortunately, this reason remains a mystery. The procession may refer to a ritual involving the minor deities, probably the protectors of animals. The figures may also possibly be foreign deities. Whatever the truth of the matter, the long lock of hair hanging from their headdress indicates that they are marginal figures in the classical pantheon.

From 1839-42 to 1877-83, this painting bore Pieter de Hooch's monogram with the not unlikely date of 1658. Contemporary with the early work of de Hooch and Vermeer, it was formerly attributed to each but is quite distinct from the latter's experiments. Alluding - as does the Ter Borch-inspired picture in the background - to the vain and gallant pastimes of the absent mistress of the house, this is a subtly moralistic piece, a fascinating exercise in perspective, and a painting of poetic calm.
Perspective and poetry
What is striking here at first is the absence of subject, or at least of any figures to animate this peaceful Dutch interior. Hoogstraten focused all his attention on the rigorous spatial construction. Depth of field is rendered through the succession of receding planes of motifs that seem to fit into one another: namely, the picture frame, the two door casings, and the two paintings hanging on the back wall. The illusion of perspective is subtly enhanced by the oblique lines of the various tiled floors, as well as by the alternating contrast of warm light and shadows. The painting becomes a sort of trompe l'oeil, a window or a door open onto the atmosphere of another century. A delightful poetic mood, rhythmically structured by lines and color, radiates from the whole, bringing to mind the contemporary experiments of Pieter de Hooch.
Symbolism with a moralizing intent
Despite the stunning rendition of spatial illusion, one should avoid seeing in this canvas the product of a mere interplay of forms. The apparent simplicity and naiveté of the subject hides a moralizing intention. Hoogstraten did not place his objects randomly in this quiet bourgeois interior. Most have a symbolic meaning that would have been obvious at the time. The slippers, lying in full view in the painting's center, have just been tossed off hastily in the hallway. These small shoes, meant to be worn inside the house, become a sign of a depraved existence now that they have been discarded. The mistress of the house has abandoned her tranquil domestic activities: she has negligently left her broom leaning against the wall and interrupted her reading (the book, significantly, is closed) for an amorous rendez-vous. The painting within the painting - a Father Admonishing his Daughter by Casper Netscher (1655, Gotha Museum) - is a variant of a work by Gerard Ter Borch denouncing venal love. The vanity of this gallant demimonde is fully contained in the image of the snuffed candle, the symbol of time wasted in following loose morals. Hoogstraten's great genius is exemplified by this artful denunciation of amorous adventures, which are suggested but remain concealed from the viewer in an alcove at the end of a second succession of rooms. 
The painting's chaotic history
The painting's history, filled with turns and twists, was affected by the overbearing shadow of famous painters such as Vermeer or de Hooch. Many ever-changing attributions for this painting were tossed around. At certain moments, it was even thought to be an 18th-century or early 19th-century pastiche. In the 19th century, some collectors went so far as to have new motifs painted onto the canvas: first a little dog, then Pieter de Hooch's monogram with the date 1658, and finally a little girl, seated. The picture seemed too empty and there was a desire to fill up the 'decor' so as to bring the work closer to the art of someone like Vermeer or de Hooch. Luckily, all the successive additions were easily removed, and the painting restored to its original purity, so characteristic of Hoogstraten.

This wine cooler was commissioned in 1782, under Louis XVI, as part of a service for the Gobelet du Roi, the department of the royal household responsible for the bread, fruit, and drink served at the king's table. Deliveries were made until 1790, helping the Sèvres manufactory to carry on despite the revolutionary upheaval. The shape of this ""ordinary"" or everyday wine cooler was designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis. The painted decoration of the example in the Louvre is by Geneviève Taillandier.
An ""ordinary"" wine cooler
A wine cooler containing crushed ice was used to cool bottles of wine before serving. The shape of this ""ordinary"" wine cooler was designed at the Vincennes manufactory in the early 1750s by Jean-Claude Duplessis (d. 1774). The Louvre wine cooler is cylindrical in form and rests on a low foot whose edge is painted with a thick gold fillet. It has two scrolled handles picked out in gold and a wide mouth whose rim has a gold saw-tooth decoration. This shape had a lasting success at Sèvres, remaining in production until the 1790s. A hole was made in the bottom of the Louvre wine cooler at some point, no doubt to turn it into a flower-pot holder.
The ""Gobelet du Roi""
The Gobelet du Roi was one of seven departments making up the Maison-Bouche, the royal kitchens. With the Cuisine-Bouche, the Gobelet belonged to the Bouche du Roi, the body responsible solely for the tables of the King and the royal family. The officers of the Gobelet were divided again into two sub-departments, the Panneterie-Bouche and the Échansonnerie-Bouche, each under its own head, assisted by twelve chefs who served at court on a quarterly basis,  and by assistants and storekeepers. The former laid the table and provided the bread, salt, table linen, and fruit; the latter served drinks and refreshments. The Gobelet du Roi service was thus mainly used for serving cold drinks, ices, sorbets, and spirits.
Decoration by Geneviève Taillandier
The Gobelet du Roi service was commissioned for the Château de Versailles by Louis XVI in 1782. Delivery was made from 1783 onward, in several stages. The Louvre wine cooler is one of a series of sixteen delivered in 1783. In total, 588 pieces were delivered that year. Many others would follow in 1786, 1787, 1788, and 1790. The painter Geneviève Taillandier, active at Sèvres from 1774 to 1798 and married to the flower painter Vincent Taillandier, was responsible for the decoration of the cooler. Its body is adorned with a garland of cornflowers (pinks), naturalistically rendered, which entwine a red line. The entire service had this same decoration. The Thiers Collection in the Louvre has other pieces from the service: a sugar pot of 1786, painted by Jacques Fontaine; a plate of 1788, decorated by Marie-Anne Gérard; a glass cooler of 1788, also by Geneviève Taillandier; and a round compotier of 1790.

A masterpiece of de Heem's Antwerp period, where he moved in 1635, and very probably his earliest still life. A large work rich in symbolic references to worldy vanities and with a moral message. Matisse copied the painting and turned its skillful decorative arrangement to good account. 
A synthesis of Dutch precision and Flemish Baroque
Elaborate still lifes of lavish meals in this genre were highly fashionable at the time. The table is piled high with luxurious glass and tableware, a variety of food and fruit, and a half-eaten pie. A lute and a recorder are resting against the table. De Heem has in fact given considerable thought to their seemingly disorderly arrangement. Largely trained in Utrecht and Leyden, he had been living in Antwerp for five years when he painted this picture, in which he achieves a brilliant synthesis of Dutch precision and Flemish Baroque.From his initial apprenticeship, he retained a taste for rendering matter and textures, which he sublimates with skillful light effects: the softness of the dark green velvet, the metallic glint of the tableware, the delicate transparency of the glass, the velvety skin of a peach, or, in contrast, shriveling lemon peel. The composition, however, is directly inspired by the Baroque style of disciples of Rubens such as Frans Snyders: the theatricality of the large mauve curtain, the crumpled drapery, and the decorative abundance on the brink of imbalance.  
A moral message
A curious meal indeed: a mixture of glasses of wine, fruit from different seasons, and musical instruments. A decorative opulence that de Heem further enriches with the symbolism he had explored during his time in Leyden. Some of the fruit evokes Christian values: cherries are considered a fruit of Paradise, peaches and apples embody the forbidden fruit, grapes symbolize redemption, and the bread and wine are clear references to the Eucharist. The food is surrounded by strong symbols frequently found in ""vanitas"" still lifes. The lute and recorder on the left recall that the pleasures of the senses, those of the ear and the table, are as ephemeral as music itself. Our attention is also subtly drawn to the blue watch strap on the edge of the table, an evocation of time's fleetingness and a symbol of the moderation to observed in the face of sensual pleasures. The globe in the top right corner, theatrically unveiled by the curtain, recalls the scope of this universal moral. 
From Louis XIV to Matisse
Jan Davidsz de Heem played an important part in the development of the still life in Flanders and Holland. The picture was widely acclaimed after its purchase by Louis XIV. Its skillful disorder and happy blend of colors and textures also fascinated the young Henri Matisse, who copied the picture in 1893 then painted his own, highly personal variation in 1916-17 (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

This coffee grinder has an illustrious history: it once belonged to Madame de Pompadour (1721-1764). It is a superb luxury item, made of three colors of gold. It was made by the jeweller and goldsmith Jean Ducrollay, who worked in Paris. The grinder is a fabulous reminder of the vogue for coffee-drinking in the 18th century and is a fine example of the outstanding objets d'art that Madame de Pompadour commissioned.
A decorative yet functional item
The coffee grinder is cylindrical in form, narrowing slightly in the middle, and it consists of three parts. The lower part can be unscrewed to remove the ground coffee. The low relief decoration depicts branches of coffee bushes. The leaves are in green gold and the berries are in rose gold, against a background of yellow gold. The decoration elegantly recalls the grinder's function.
Madame de Pompadour and the goldsmith's art
Madame de Pompadour collected objets d'art of gold. In her Paris home, the Hôtel d'Evreux - now the Palais de l'Elysée - she put together an exceptional collection of gold tableware from 1755 to 1757, including this coffee grinder, an eggcup, spoons, a coffee pot, and a spirit-of-wine dish warmer. All of these objects were stored in a wooden box, along with a salt and pepper set with accessories. Of all these pieces of gold tableware, only the coffee grinder has survived. The other pieces are known only from the inventory of Madame de Pompadour's possessions after her death in 1764. She obviously loved gold and silverware, and commissioned pieces from a number of suppliers, including Auguste, Durand, and Jean Ducrollay. The latter was one of the most respected jewelers and goldsmiths in Paris in the 18th century. He specialized in small objects such as snuffboxes and other small decorative boxes.
The fashion for coffee
Coffee, which originated in the East, was introduced to Paris in 1670, and it became highly fashionable, both at court and in high society in general. By the 18th century, its consumption had become so widespread that Diderot and D'Alembert included a whole article on it in their great Encyclopedia, giving instructions on how to prepare coffee and describing a type of small portable grinder. Madame de Pompadour's coffee grinder, although obviously made of much more precious materials, fits the description exactly, even down to the details of the grinding mechanism, which is still in place.

Like its now lost companion piece, Death of a Stag, this presentation of the good life in high society was painted for the dining room in the King's private apartment at Fontainebleau, where it was hung with Charles André Vanloo's Halt during a Hunt and Charles Parrocel's Halt of the King's Mounted Grenadiers, both now in the Louvre
The hunt as pretext
Hunt Breakfast was painted in 1837 for the main dining room in Louis XV's suite at Fontainebleau. This lightweight example of the history painter's art points up the change of taste in interior decoration that came with the Regency, with pastoral and the hunt replacing the mythological imagery of the past. The royal hunt had already made its appearance in such works as Bernard Van Orley's Hunts of Maximilian, but with the emphasis on the hunt itself. Here we see the pause, pretext for an outdoor meal in which action is supplanted by the pleasures of the table, flirtation and amorous plotting.  
A master of all genres
Son of the portraitist François de Troy, the artist set out to become the leading painter of his generation. Although he ultimately fell victim to Neoclassical reaction, he remains one of the 18th century's great history painters and had a considerable influence on the young Joseph-Marie Vien. Born in Paris in 1679, Jean-François de Troy studied with his father before spending the years 1699-1706 in Italy. Returning as an admirer of Veronese and Titian, he was admitted to the Academy of Painting and Sculpture as a history painter. While the creator of such large religious works as Christ before Pilate, also in the Louvre, he excelled in all the genres - lovers' trysts, portrayals of fashion, mythology, portraits - while drawing on a visual repertoire that was often a pretext for showing the female nude. He contributed to the decoration of the royal apartments, one example being this Hunt Breakfast, created for the palace at Fontainebleau. Deeply disappointed at not receiving major commissions, de Troy painted seven tapestry cartoons for the royal Gobelins manufactory. His Story of Esther series enjoyed great success and was woven several times in the course of the 18th century.  
Last years in Rome
Appointed director of the French Academy in Rome, de Troy moved there in 1738 and designed a new series of tapestry cartoons. However, his Story of Jason and Medea was badly received at the 1748 Salon and, falling from favor, he was replaced at the Academy by Charles-Joseph Natoire. He stayed on in Rome, where he died in 1752.

This painting executed by Martin Drölling in 1815, whose theme recalls genre painting and the Northern schools of the 17th century, was a frank success at the Salon of 1817—indeed, it continued to be exhibited at the Palais du Luxembourg long after the artist’s death that same year. The atmosphere and limpid light of this Interior of a Kitchen inevitably evoke the moments of domestic tranquility that were so often painted by the Dutch and Flemish masters.
A genre scene
The scene takes place in a country kitchen. It is illuminated in the middle background by a high window opening onto foliage and a large patch of clear sky. A young girl sitting in front of the open window with her feet on a little chair has raised her head from her needlework, as though someone has just arrived. A woman holding a piece of red material sits on a chair with her back to the viewer, looking over her shoulder. A little girl sits on the flagstone floor, next to a basket at the woman’s feet; her doll lies forgotten as she dangles a string for her pet cat. A curtain plays with the light that shines diagonally across the room, backlighting the figures and the contours of the objects, some of which are discernible on a shelf in the half-light to the left of the kitchen. Every detail in this painting—the attitudes, poses, and clothes of the three figures, the brooms and pans, a pitcher holding a few flowers, an abandoned plate, a candlestick—is reminiscent of the peaceful atmosphere of Nordic scenes, the tranquil simplicity of the interiors of Pieter de Hooch.
The separation of companion pieces
This scene of daily life had a companion piece entitled Interior of a Dining Room, a similar composition set in a bourgeois home. These two interior scenes came together for the Salon of 1817, before being separated for good. The figures in this painting are surrounded by everyday domestic objects and rustic furniture, painted with realism and precision and with the suggestion of trompe-l’œil that was typical of this artist’s work. The open window at the back of the painting gives real depth to the scene; the gaze of the two women creates a sudden complicity with the viewer, as if inviting him into their little private world. But the intimist portrayal of the middle class, rarely depicted in early 19th-century France, soon exasperated the painters of the realist school. This painting, though perfectly characteristic of the painter and his period, was criticized for a certain coldness, a rather bland interpretation of the familiar domestic space.
Drölling and literature
Although Martin Drölling was little known by the general public of his time, writer Honoré de Balzac knew of his work, to which he referred in two novels of the Comédie Humaine: ""La Femme de trente ans"", and ""Pierre Grassou"". He was no doubt attracted by the artist’s painstaking depiction of interiors—a tendency he shared in his highly detailed literary descriptions. The contemporary trend in painting was for genre scenes, and in literature for the description of interiors; this painting by Drölling reflects the meeting of these two art forms.

This large biconical storage jar was no doubt half-buried, with only the upper part showing. The typically Coptic decoration shows a couple of lions attacking a gazelle (or an onager), with fish, birds, and a female bust among berry-bearing plants.
A luxury storage jar
This large biconical vessel with its low wide neck and four small added handles typifies Coptic design and manufacture of storage jars. The lower halves of these vessels were simply coated with slip before being concealed in a storehouse floor or in stands made of wood or stone. Only the upper halves were visible, decorated with varying degrees of skill and care.On this jar, a frieze features lions, birds, fish, and horse-like creatures surrounded by plants with black berries. A frame surrounds a female bust and a fish, which is standing on its tail like a leaping carp, apparently holding its belly in with the effort. Was this fish added to compensate for an off-center portrait, or was it the protagonist of a long-lost story?
Coptic fashion
The large black eyes in this simple portrait seem to gaze at the spectator (perhaps the customer). The woman's tunic is adorned with decorative motifs, and she has a shawl with crescent-shaped motifs around her shoulders. Her wealth is suggested by her jewelry: three neck rings, a diadem, and two large ribbed ball earrings with pendants, which are attached to her hair. Earrings of this kind were familiar items of Byzantine jewelry, but it is most unusual to see them attached this way. Was this a Coptic fashion, a liberal interpretation of the crown with pearl pendants represented in many imperial portraits, or was it simply the potter's choice? Coptic textiles often featured male or female busts as portraits or allegories of virtues, months, or seasons. This legacy from the Hellenistic and Roman world, often used in mosaic designs, continued long after the Arab conquest.A frieze completes the decoration, with a couple of lions fighting over an onager or a gazelle. A flat ""bolti"" fish (a familiar feature of Coptic ceramics) is watching two ring-necked birds pecking at a berry-laden stem. Two other gazelle-like creatures gallop in front of them, and two more bolti fish are peacefully swimming.
Storage jars
A multitude of jars for protecting and preserving food have been found at every excavation site, but this one is exceptional in quality. The wide mouths of these large recipients made it easy to reach inside them. Their surface was usually given a protective coating, and sometimes the upper half was decorated with simple sketches drawn from a repertory of geometric or animal forms. The jars often had two small symmetrical handles (not four, as is the case here), and lids in the form of plates or upturned dishes, which were probably secured to the handles.

The painting is an example of Beuckelaer's justifiably celebrated rustic scenes, depicted with remarkable gusto.
The kitchen of a noble residence
The scene takes place in a large room suggestive of the kitchen of a castle or fine country residence. The foreground depicts a pantry full of foodstuffs. A mallard duck lies on top of a pile of napkins, with a hen to the left. A cockerel hangs from a beam, next to a salmon steak. The table, in the foreground to the left, is laden with a large dish containing chestnuts and fruit, including a lemon – an exotic luxury in northern Europe at the time. A leg of veal lies on top of everything else, surrounded by storage jars. Above it we see a metal cooking-pot, hanging from a beam, silhouetted against an open view of a landscape in the background. The right-hand side of the picture is dominated by the figure of a serving-girl, just back from a visit to the market, carrying a basket of vegetables and fruit: a cabbage, carrots, cherries and gherkins. Behind her, we see a huge room with a large fireplace. A cook is pouring sauce over a piece of poultry cooking on a spit. A brazier is heating up under her skirts, and she is being fondled by the figure of an old man.
This painting is not a ""still-life"" in the strictest sense of the term: in addition to the human figures, small living creatures enliven the static depiction of produce and foodstuffs, including a snail climbing up the edge of the basket and, a little higher up, a caterpillar on a cabbage. A butterfly has alighted on an open door just above the slice of salmon, and two insects may be seen on the leg of veal. The fat fly, and perhaps even the butterfly, may be intended as a visual trick – the creatures are so perfectly depicted that inattentive viewers might mistake them for real insects on the surface of the panel.
Unbridled sensuality
The heap of foodstuffs fills almost half of this colorful composition. The still-life itself is framed by the red of the beams, and the serving-girl's dress. The composition is also punctuated by large areas of white, from the laundry hanging in the top left-hand corner, to the pile of napkins, and the serving-girl's blouse. The careful scene-setting, and the organization of the colors, contribute to the painting's ""aesthetic of opulence."" But as so often in large ""kitchen pieces"" of this type, the everyday scene expresses a moral message, too. In all of the kitchen pieces attributed to Joachim Beuckelaer (and his uncle and master Pieter Aertsen) the protagonists seem gripped by a kind of frenzied sensuality. Some contemporary commentators identified the serving classes' daily physical contact with foodstuffs, and the heat of the kitchens, as the root causes of their apparently unbridled sensuality and excess. This is clearly expressed in the scene depicted in the background of the picture, and may also be implicit in the representation of the serving-girl's hand, resting on the rounded form of the cabbage.
The serving girl
Pliny the Elder's Natural History – a work widely translated and quoted in the 16th century – mentions large cabbages as symbols of a life of excessive luxury and expense. Here, this relatively straightforward interpretation is coupled with a tribute to the serving girl's simple dignity, as seen in many earlier works by Beuckelaer's uncle and master, Pieter Aertsen. The girl's monumental figure is the dominant motif in this work, painted in 1566, the year of the great iconoclastic riots in Amsterdam, when the Protestant uprisings destroyed countless works of religious art. Paintings such as this gave rise to an important genre in the city of Antwerp. During the 17th century, paintings depicting tables laden with food became much larger, often featuring expansive landscape-format compositions, with human figures relegated to a secondary role.

The so-called Napoleon III apartments in the Louvre are the work of the architect Lefuel, and were installed between 1856 and 1861 in the new wing on the rue de Rivoli which connected the Louvre to the Tuileries. They were intended as reception rooms for the Ministry of State, an important government department. The rooms are generally in the Louis XIV style, especially the dining room, whose large buffet is, however, entirely representative of the prevailing eclecticism.
The dining room and buffet under the Second Empire
The Napoleon III apartments were intended for receptions, so the dining room was used only for banquets. The room testifies to the hosts' love of luxury, sometimes to the point of ostentation. The walls were covered with paneling in the Boulle style, wallpaper, and hangings, and the décor was completed with paintings of hunting and garden scenes. The furniture consisted of a buffet, a table, chairs, and sideboards. At meals, the table had a large centerpiece by the house of Christoffle.
Decorative integration
The buffet stood at the end of the room within a semicircular bay, whose curved form it followed. The whole suite of furniture was somber in tone. Chairs, tables, console tables, pedestals for busts, and the buffet, are all in ebonized wood. With four doors in the lower part, the buffet has two side cabinets with four drawers, an étagère and a clock signed by Perrelet. The buffet is integrated with the room not only in its form but also in its ornament, which is shared by the rest of the furniture, probably designed by Lefuel himself. The style adopted for these great apartments was the style of Louis XIV, which was ""de rigueur"" for official buildings under the Second Empire. The furniture was delivered between 1859 and 1861: a number of cabinetmakers were involved in its production, but the records do not establish who was responsible for what. As in the case of the décor, the firms commissioned were often not the most famous of their time.
An opulent piece
The ornamentation of this very large buffet, which is richly adorned with scrollwork, reveals the prevailing eclecticism of the Second Empire: the decorative repertoire (lozenge panels with rosettes, consoles, a lion mask) is derived from the Louis XIV style, while other features (the garlands of flowers, the seashells, and the keystone motifs at the corners of the doors) recall the rocaille. All these ornaments are gilded, which heightens the sense of opulence, and the very high quality of the gilding is nicely set off by the ebonized wood particularly popular under the Second Empire.

According to some commentators, this glimpse of domestic happiness portrays the artist's own family. An invaluable testimony to lifestyle at the time of Louis XV, the picture shows a rocaille interior complete with wall lamps, elaborate wall clock, exotic Chinese statuette, and indulgence in the current coffee craze.    
A family portrait?
One of Boucher's rare excursions into the interior genre, this work has sometimes been interpreted as a family scene, with Madame Boucher seated on the right, their children, and on the left the painter's sister feeding the little girl. In an elegant sitting room the family is seen taking coffee, the latest luxury import. The relationships between the figures, the exchange of looks, and the little girl turning towards the viewer express a striving for simplicity and real intimacy. This was a time when approaches to raising children were changing and toys were being made for them: the girl, wearing a protective headband, holds a wooden horse and has a doll at her feet.  
A rococo interior
Bursting with freshness and grace, this painting details a way of life less solemn than Chardin's. The painter of happiness is bent on telling all: he shows furniture, diverse objects, silk garments, and lacework in a way that echoes his varied fields of activity. As an ornamenter, for example, Boucher fitted out a number of royal residences; as a decorator/designer he worked for the theater and the opera, and created many tapestry designs for the royal manufactories at Beauvais and Les Gobelins. With its delicate blues, greens, ochres, and reds, this interior is suffused with a soft glow reflected in the richly gilded woodwork.   
A Northern School view of the everyday
During the period 1739-46, this painter of mythological trysts extended his range to genre scenes influenced by the 17th-century Dutch masters and, most directly, by Jean-François de Troy. What he offers here is a view of the everyday - a moment of the simple happiness family life can bring.

These two sugar casters are modeled to represent a slave couple from the Americas: a man and a woman carrying sugar cane sheaves on their back. Because there is no mark on the casters, it is difficult to ascertain who their author is or who commissioned them. They fit however the description of the sugar casters owned by Louis-Henri, Duke of Bourbon (1692-1740). They therefore date probably from the period 1730-40 and bear testimony to the great creativity of rocaille goldsmiths.
Sugar casters
Under the Ancien Régime, sugar was one of the ingredients always present on the table. The sugar caster already appeared in the 1600's. Around 1700 it took on a baluster shape with a pierced dome and became part of the centerpiece. This form went out of use before the middle of the 18th century. The two sugar casters in the Louvre are modeled like statuettes sculpted in the round and represent slaves from the Americas carrying sheaves of sugar canes. Theses objects,  whose iconography designates their function, are not unique: Madame de Pompadour owned two casters in the shape of figures carrying sugar canes, another pair, dating from 1738-9, is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, and two more are listed in the inventory of the Duke of Penthièvre for the Château d'Anet.
Very likely identification
It is extremely rare for the works of goldsmiths not to have a mark. On the base of the two casters, there are, however, traces of the erased coat of arms of the Duke of Bourbon. We find confirmation of this provenance in the inventory list drawn up after the Duke's death, which contains the description of the two objects. It is therefore possible to date the production of the casters, historically, as prior to 1740 - the year of the Duke of Bourbon's death - and, stylistically, as later than 1730. A close study of the fine workmanship indicates that their author most probably was one of the Parisian goldsmiths working for the Crown who were installed in the Louvre. Of these, Claude II Ballin produced several pieces sharing certain traits with the Louvre pair. For instance, three centerpieces now in the Ermitage Museum in Saint-Petersburg show the same careful attention to detail and assign the same importance to the representation of the human figure. 
Objects that demonstrate the fantasy of the rocaille style
The two figures from the Americas stand on a small, finely delineated pedestal, which represents in a realistic manner a plot of ground with a tree stump and some already cut sugar cane stalks. In addition to his sheaf of sugar canes, the man carries a bow and quiver slung over his shoulder. As for the woman, she carries a small bag. All the elements are very finely outlined with chasing, manifesting the attachment to detail typical of rocaille silver. The theme itself, imbued with the colonizer's  vision of the world, reveals the period's taste for exotic characters and objects. These two sugar casters announce other works such as the twelve salts created by François-Thomas Germain (1760) for the service of Joseph I of Portugal, now in the Ajuda Palace and at the Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon, which represent tiny figures of people from the Americas. Or the gold sugar casters of Louis XV by Jacques Roettiers, dating from 1764, and adorned with bas-reliefs depicting the gathering of the sugar canes.

This silver vessel testifies to the taste for luxury tableware among the dignitaries of the Achaemenid Empire. Animals were often chosen to decorate these splendid pieces in an Iranian tradition reaching back thousands of years. In Iran, animals appeared on painted pottery in the 4th millennium BC, especially on the large bushels found at Susa. 
A rhyton in the shape of a gazelle
This vessel, called a rhyton, in the shape of an animal is made up of two parts. The horn itself is decorated along almost its entire lenglth with fluting typical of metal tableware in the Achaemenid period (539-330 BC). The fluting is finished with a narrow gilt metal band decorated with strips alternating with inverted lotus flowers. The rim is smooth and flared.The horn is fitted into the protome, which still shows signs of gilding, in the shape of a gazelle sitting with its forelegs folded under its chest. It once had antlers slotted into two small protuberances. Most of the details of the animal's body are engraved except for its eyes and eyelids. According to Pierre Amiet, the rhyton is generally in the Achaemenid style, but the realism of the animal's head suggests that it was made in a provincial workshop.  
The origins of the rhyton
Rhytons were common in the ancient Near East. However, the first animal-shaped vases seem to have been made in Anatolia early in the 2nd millennium, at the time of the Assyrian trading posts (Louvre, CA 1884). But it was in the 8th century BC that this type of beaker began to become popular in Assyria, as can be seen in the reliefs from Sargon's palace in Khorsabad. The murals depict courtiers drinking from lion-headed cups. Rhytons dating from the 7th century BC have also been found in Iranian Kurdistan, in the region of Ziwiye: two are made of terra-cotta while others are in silver, with a very stylized body (Louvre, ao27909). This stylization heralded the rhytons of the Achaemenid period, which typically have a horn-shaped cup, like this one. Another rhyton in the Louvre (ao3115) is characteristic of classical Achaemenid art in the treatment of the animal, especially at the shoulders. They are decorated with a double ring pattern also found on the enameled bricks of Darius the Great's palace in Susa.
An immense empire
The Persian Achaemenid Empire covered an immense territory stretching from Lydia to the Indus, and from Egypt to the Black Sea. Darius the Great set up a veritable administration and divided his empire into satrapies. He encouraged the development of grandiose, luxurious official art, which became the model for all the provinces of the kingdom.

Steles representing the deceased's nourishment in the afterlife were the principal element of Egyptian funerary art. This is one of the most ancient and best preserved. Nefertiabet was a princess during the reign of King Cheops; the best artists of the day were called upon to portray her food for the afterlife.
The fundamental funerary scene
The seated woman is facing rightward, as is the inscription above her head (""The king's daughter, Nefertiabet""). This was the usual orientation for writing, recognizable from the direction of the heads of the animal hieroglyphs. The princess, wearing a panther-skin dress, sits on a stool with bull's feet, adorned with a papyrus umbel. She stretches one hand toward a white stone pedestal table on a cylindrical terracotta stand, which bears slices of white bread with a golden crust. These elements represent the purely pictorial part of the stele; the remainder—more than half the total surface— is adorned with text only. The image itself is very pictographic, as if detached from time and space. The scene is a familiar one, reproduced thousands of times and consecrated by time and usage: the deceased's nourishment in the afterlife. A simple palette of colors—red, yellow, black, and green (now faded)—embellishes the extremely delicate relief work.
A play between text and image
The text is presented in a variety of ways. All the inscriptions are oriented toward the princess (apart from her name), since they express the offerings made to her. A double rectangle above the table contains the inscription of items such as cosmetics, drinks, and various delicacies. A large vertical panel on the right, divided into three sections, lists the many pieces of fabric offered to the princess. Finally, a number of ideograms used pictorially, in front of the princess's face and around the table, express the essential elements of the offering: ""libation"" (in front of her face), ""lustration"" before her chest, ""leg of beef"", ""ribs"", ""duck"", ""linen"", ""crockery"", ""bread"", ""beer"", ""meat and poultry"", ""thousand"", ""thousand"", ""thousand!"". The words here are an integral part of the image.
A vital function
Both text and image have a role to play in this timeless work. On the death of Nefertiabet (no doubt a sister of King Cheops and daughter of Snefru), this stele was embedded in the outer wall of her tomb at Giza, at the foot of the great pyramid. It was subsequently walled up, and thereby protected from the ravages of time. The stele's raison d'être was essentially practical: the images it featured (Nefertiabet's food and material possessions) were brought to life from the moment of its creation and for ever after—thereby ensuring the princess eternal life and its attendant pleasures.

Very little is known about the life of Floris Van Schooten, although he is recorded in Haarlem from 1612 to 1655,. He painted numerous kitchen and market scenes, as well as a great many compositions of tables set with food, including still-lifes featuring his recurrent favourite motifs of ham and cheese, as seen here.
An Ontbijtje: a breakfast piece, or snack
A pewter dish sits in the center of a table partly covered with a cloth marked by sharply-creased folds. A cut ham sits in the dish, next to an impressive pile of three of cheeses and, to the left, a blue ceramic plate loaded with food. In the foreground are a round loaf of bread, two slices of black bread resting against the edge of a metal plate holding a slice of ham, a knife, and – aligned with the three cheeses – a small round loaf and some pancakes. In the background, a drinking-glass, a grey earthenware jug, and a pewter pot may be seen against a dark ground. The composition depicts a table set for an informal, picnic-style meal, a snack or, perhaps, a hearty breakfast.
Known in the northern European tradition as an ""ontbitje"" (meaning a still-life depicting a breakfast, or a light meal to be taken at any time of day) pictures of this type followed a stringent set of aesthetic principles and compositional rules. The table, shown from the front and aligned with the bottom edge of the picture space, is covered with a cloth, which is usually white. The viewer looks down onto the objects arranged on the tabletop, and these are usually spread out, and clearly separated from one another. The picture presents an overall view of the foodstuffs, which are seemingly in the process of being eaten.
A conventional composition
This painting's subject and treatment are typical of early pictures of tables set for a meal. The composition centers on the motif of the ham – clearly highlighted in the middle – but  is counterbalanced by the pyramid of cheeses, and the other carefully-aligned items of food. The ham and the tablecloth, which may have some religious significance, are frequent motifs in Van Schooten's paintings of meals. The white cloth and the cheeses may well refer to the Christian fasting period of Lent, when meat was forbidden, although they may equally be depicted here simply as well-known examples of staple regional produce. Painters often depicted cheeses piled in a pyramid shape, as here, with half a large round of yellowish, orange-colored cheese on the bottom, and ever-smaller cheeses on top (usually two). The darkest, most mature cheese, with a hard texture and grey-brown color is generally uppermost. The food is depicted with great technical virtuosity. Clearly-visible signs indicate that this improvised meal is in the process of being eaten: the cheeses and ham are marked with irregular cuts from a knife, one of the pancakes has been nibbled, a plate has been prepared for someone, and the knife – balanced precariously on the edge of the table – looks as if it has just been put down. The resulting picture conveys a sense of life and spontaneity, despite its somewhat rigid, conventional composition.
A painter of tables set with food
Little is known about the life of Floris van Schooten. We know that he was active in Haarlem in 1605, and he is recorded again in 1639, as dean of the Guild of St Luke (the painters' professional guild). He is mentioned again as a member of the city's Corporation in 1641. Van Schooten was best known for his many kitchen interiors and market scenes, in the tradition of Aertsen and Beuckelaer – pictures which marked his beginnings as a professional painter. He was also noted for his serene images of tables set with food, including this restrained composition with its subtle monochrome aspect. The palette of predominantly red-orange colors contrasts with the dark ground, throwing the motifs into sharp relief, and giving the painting an unquestionable authority and presence.

This tea, coffee and chocolate service, which originally bore the arms of Queen Marie Leczinska (1703-68), commemorates the birth of the Dauphin (father of Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X) in 1729). Most of the pieces, by Henry-Nicolas Cousinet, are in gilded silver, and they bear witness to the emergence of the rococo style. Other pieces, in Chinese, Japanese and Meissen porcelain, show the fascination for this material in the first half of the eighteenth century.
A service for all occasions
The service Queen Marie Leszczynska received after the birth of the dauphin comprises numerous pieces for taking tea, coffee, or chocolate, beverages considered exotic at the time and hugely popular at court. The chest contains objects in gilded silver: a tea caddy, a coffee caddy, a chocolate pot on a lamp stand, a spice box (it was customary to add spices to hot chocolate), a coffee grinder, a small, seashell-shaped cream jug, a candlestick, a tea strainer, a bell, a funnel, sugar tongs, and a long-handled spoon. There are also porcelain pieces: two tea bowls with saucers, a teapot, two cups and two stands set in silver gilt, and a sugar bowl. The service was kept in the queen's large study at Versailles and could be used while traveling.  
The silver-gilt pieces
The pieces in silver gilt are stamped with the hallmark of the silversmith Henry-Nicolas Cousinet, who later became sculptor to the Prince de Condé. The gentle, bulbous, dissymmetrical forms of these pieces and the choice of decoration bear witness to the emergence of the rococo style in official art. The small, seashell-shaped cream jug has a highly curved rim and a scribed handle. The chocolate pot with a dolphin spout has a stand with three dolphin legs - allusions to the birth of the Dauphin - and is decorated with small garlands; the lid is surmounted by a tiny bouquet of flowers. The finely detailed chasing is highly emblematic of the rococo spirit and of Cousinet's craftsmanship. The dolphin theme reappears several times on other objects in the service, as do reeds, waves, seashells, and flowers, all recurrent motifs in the rococo repertoire.  
The porcelain pieces
The bowls, saucers, cups, and teapot are from different sources. Some of the pieces are Chinese and Japanese, others are from the Meissen manufactory in Saxony, whose intial production attempted to imitate Chinese porcelain. The two bowls and their stands and the teapot are decorated with flowers and landscapes evoking Chinese motifs. The two cups are plain white porcelain set in silver gilt. Chinese white porcelain was greatly appreciated and was imitated by European manufactories. For this reason, it was customary to set them, like most far-eastern works, in gilded bronze or in more precious metals, as is the case with the Louvre service. The presence of such objects in Queen Marie Leszczynska's service illustrates the near-fantastical interest in the Orient in the eighteenth century.

The Graincourt Treasure was found in the Pas-de-Calais département in 1958. It reveals the popularity of silver tableware in Gaul in the 3rd century AD. The Gallo-Roman silversmiths readily drew on decorative motifs dating from the Hellenistic period, adapting them into remarkable original compositions, such as this plate decorated with fish. The décor, on the theme of fishing, is reminiscent of the marine still lifes particularly associated with mosaic flooring.
The Gallo-Roman Graincourt Treasure
The Graincourt Treasure was found in Graincourt-lès-Havricourt in 1958 during an operation to defuse a wartime bomb. The treasure consisted of nine pieces of silver tableware, including this plate, and was probably buried for safekeeping some time during the Germanic invasions that ravaged Gaul during the second half of the 3rd century AD. It seems that the names of the owners are marked on the backs of some of the pieces in the form of graffiti. Silver tableware had been particularly prized in the Roman empire since the 1st century BC and the trend spread to Gaul in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. A number of Gallo-Roman sites have given up similar treasure troves, including Chaourse in the Aisne département and Rethel in the Ardennes. The sheer quantity of such prestigious pieces reflects their popularity among the wealthy and the taste for luxury that noble families were able to indulge in the provinces of the empire. 
A marine still life
The decoration of this circular plate is remarkable both in terms of the originality of the subject and the sensitive way the space is used. The theme is a marine still life or a fishing scene where only the fisherman is missing. The central medallion depicts fish, lobsters or crayfish, a basket of shellfish, and two dead birds. The frieze around the flat rim of the plate takes up the same theme. It is decorated with a regular motif of a dead animal, probably a hare, alternating with water birds, octopuses, fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, along with equipment used for fishing and navigation, such as anchors, oars, nets and hoop nets, baskets, and amphorae. The artist took great care with the decoration, which is extremely realistic, particularly in details such as the birds' feathers, the scales of the fish, and the weave of the wicker baskets. 
Gallo-Roman metalworking: inspired by Hellenistic designs
The fishing scene was not dreamed up by the Graincourt silversmiths. It belongs to a repertoire of decorative motifs that dates from a few centuries earlier, during the Hellenistic period, possibly originating in the workshops of Alexandria.  Many pieces of bronze and silver tableware decorated with similar motifs have survived, as well as examples of mosaic flooring, particularly in Africa. Such images originally included fishermen at work. Roman goldsmiths drew on these Hellenistic scenes and adapted them to create new compositions, in which the decorative aspect of the still life took precedence over the narrative dimension.

The Vegetable Market was painted around 1660-61 at a moment when the art of Metsu - who was living in the area - was reaching its peak. Through this spirited representation of daily life, the painter makes a reference to a popular comic play, which explains the otherwise surprising presence of an impertinent valet disguised as a red buffoon. The painting's large size and its gentle, evocative rendition of the cityscape define it as one of Metsu's masterpieces. 
A small open-air theater
This greens and vegetable market stood by the Prinsengracht canal in the very prosperous city of Amsterdam. Gabriel Metsu had been living near the canal since 1657 and was therefore able to observe the life of this little world attentively. The painter composed a true tableau vivant, strongly influenced by the theater of the time. Indeed, both the type of commerce represented and the very choice of vegetables depicted correspond quite precisely to a passage from the Het Moortje (1615), a farce by G. A. Bredero, which was very popular in this period. The foreground, where the main characters are placed, is brightly lit in a way that enhances the more vivid colors - red, green, and white - each one more brilliant than the other. This colorful animation contrasts with the muted brown tones of the background and with the peaceful cityscape structured by the regular rhythm and geometry of the façades. 
The animated life of the market
The composition of this genre scene performed in the open air is quite entertaining. On the painting's left side, a shrew, her hands firmly planted on her hips, is hotly haggling over the quality or the price of vegetables. An agreeable, plump matronly woman stoically ignores her bickering with her head turned away as if to address the viewer. Two animals on the right of the composition seem to echo this dialogue, not without a dose of humor. Rooster and dog stand eyeing each other, while the precarious balance of the wicker basket lets one imagine the merry confusion of hairs and feathers to come. In the picture's center, as if isolated from the market's agitation, a little scene of flirtation unfolds. An ardent gallant, clad in the elegant costume of a Burgundian, is courting a sweet housewife who stands listening to him with shy restraint, though not without interest. 
An exceptional painting in Metsu's repertoire
Both the bright and colorful tones and the clumsy rendition of certain relatively stiff characters standing in the background bring to mind the artist's Leyden period. The painting can therefore be dated to around 1660-61. Deftly combining realism in the representation of the market scene with theatrical references, this picture is exceptional in Metsu's repertoire. Of a relatively large size for this type of subject, it is the painter's masterpiece in which he expressed his full ambition as an artist, as well as demonstrating the importance of genre painting.

This early masterpiece by Chardin was immediately judged worthy of the finest Flemish examples (Snyders, Fyt). In The Ray, “this strange monster”, Proust admired “the beauty of its vast and delicate structure, tinted with red blood, blue nerves and white muscles, like the nave of a polychromatic cathedral”.

	A “false” still life
Placed in contrast to the cauldron and pitcher — inert accessories at the right — to the left appears the tense and strange figure of a kitten, fur raised, seemingly frightened by a scene taking place outside of the painting. The skinned ray, evocative of Rembrandt’s Slaughtered Ox, with the odd assortment of objects arranged around it, was a source of astonishment to all painters — even as far as Matisse — for the riveting power of the animal’s vacant and ghostly gaze. The realism of the different elements of this false still life has forever served as a model to artists.

	A reception piece
Chardin’s reception piece to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1728, The Ray, with its companion piece The Buffet, marks the beginning of the artist’s professional career. The painting remained in the collections of the Academy, before entering, during the French Revolution in 1793, the Muséum Central des Arts, which would later become the Louvre.

The tureen in the Louvre was part of the famous Penthièvre-Orléans table service. The set, originally commissioned by Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse (1678-1737), was augmented several times by various goldsmiths. The tureen, with its oval and curved form, is the work of Edme-Pierre Balzac (1705-after 1781) who produced two identical ones for this service. The second tureen is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.
What is a tureen?
A tureen is an oval-shaped recipient, generally set on a platter, which is fit with a liner and presented with a large oval spoon and a serving fork. Its origin is somewhat of a mystery. This type of vessel is probably a luxury version of the more humble earthenware with neither feet nor handles used in the kitchen to prepare pâtés. On the other hand, it seems that silver tureens were meant for dishes that were more like stews. Set on the table along with round-shaped pots-à-oille, tureens were a major part of dinner services. In the first half of the 18th century, tureens and pots-à-oille appeared in services in equal numbers that were always the same, but this equilibrium did not last.
The Penthièvre-Orléans service
The oldest pieces of the service were produced by Thomas Germain (1673-1748) for Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse, third legitimated child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, Great Admiral of France and Master of the Hunt. The son of the Count of Toulouse, Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre (1725-1793) commissioned a second group of pieces for the set. This order was divided between two goldsmiths, Antoine-Sébastien Durand and Edme-Pierre Balzac. The Duke's daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon inherited the service after her father died. She married Louis-Joseph-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, and the silver pieces were then passed on to the House of Orléans. After the Terror, the Duchess of Orléans managed to retrieve her possessions, and upon her death, the silver was bequeathed to her son Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1773-1850), who had the family arms engraved on the service. Following the duke's decease, the set was broken up and sold off by his descendants. Balzac's tureen was part of the group ordered by the Duke of Penthièvre. The liner was added by Jean-Claude Odiot during the time of Louis-Philippe.     
A repertoire of rocaille ornaments with a hunting theme
The curved body of the tureen stands on four feet shaped like celery stalks. The celery leaves cover the sides, forming the handles. On the front and back, a rocaille cartouche encloses the arms added in the 19th century. The rim is circled with a frieze of ovolu, entrelac and acanthus foliage. A chased border of oak leaves surrounds the lid, surmounted with a finial formed by a group sculpted in the round and representing a stag attacked by two dogs. These various ornaments evoke the hunt, a theme very popular with the aristocracy and the court. The venison and the celery also refer to the tureen's content. The curving and elaborately carved forms of the recipient are still very much influenced by the rocaille fashion of the 1730s. However, certain ornaments point to a more sober evolution of this style, specifically the frieze of ovolu. Also noteworthy is the decision to leave certain areas perfectly smooth rather than decorate them.

The two saltcellars in the Louvre were part of the famous Penthièvre-Orléans service. The set, originally commissioned by Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse (1678--1737), was augmented several times by various goldsmiths. The saltcellars, composed of a crab, a turtle and a scallop, are the work of Thomas Germain and belong to the first group of pieces ordered. Masterpieces of the rocaille, they demonstrate the inventiveness of Thomas Germain.
Saltcellars
Before becoming an integral part of a centerpiece, saltcellars underwent a long series of transformations during which they were made again into independent objects. Uncovered at first, they were later equipped with one or more covered salts mounted on a base. On the table, they were placed intermittently between the other recipients, and always remained in a category of their own among tableware. In the Rocaille era, they were given an appearance designating their function, which was evoked by the choice of ornaments inspired by vegetation or by sea animals.
The Penthièvre-Orléans service
The oldest pieces of the service were produced by Thomas Germain (1673-1748), the author of the Louvre saltcellars, between 1727 and 1736. They were made for Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse, third legitimated child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, Great Admiral of France and Master of the Hunt. The son of the Count of Toulouse, Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre (1725-1793) commissioned a second group of pieces for the set. This order was divided between two goldsmiths, Antoine-Sébastien Durand and Edme-Pierre Balzac. The Duke's daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon inherited the service after her father died. She married Louis-Joseph-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, and the silver pieces were then passed on to the House of Orléans. After the Terror, the Duchess of Orléans managed to retrieve her possessions, and upon her death, the silver was bequeathed to her son Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1773-1850), who had the family arms engraved on the service. Following the duke's decease, the set was broken up and sold off by his descendants. 
A very naturalistic style
Each saltcellar rests on a pedestal in the shape of a raised terrace edged with molding that curls at the end into scrolls forming the feet. The terrace is set on a small fluted platter evoking a shell. Three sea animals are fitted on this pedestal: in the center, a turtle, on the right, a crab and on the left, a scallop, all laid on a bed of grass and seaweed. The top part of each animal is hinged and lifts to reveal the detachable gilt silver compartment, which used to contain the salt. The shells of the turtle and of the crab, as well as of the scallop are worked over finely and precisely with chasing to bring out their texture. The extremely naturalistic rendition of sea flora and fauna demonstrates both the sharpness of Germain's eye and the perfection attained by the goldsmith in the mastering of his art.

These porous jars, placed in purpose-designed cavities on the stand, kept water cool thanks to evaporation. Excess water seeped through the ceramic, then flowed from the cavities into a pipe that emerged through the lion's mouth carved at the front of the stand. The water that dripped from the gargoyle's mouth was collected in a container.
An original furniture item
The low stone table designed to hold the water jars is rather squat and rustic in appearance. It was made from a block originally used in a pharaonic edifice. The table ends are carved in flat relief: one side features hieroglyphs, but a leg is all that remains of a figured scene on the other side. On the front face are the schematized forequarters of a lion, its head resting between its outstretched forepaws, its mouth perforated to let the water flow through.The lion has always been associated with water in the Mediterranean world; even today, fountain water still spurts from lions' muzzles. Such symbolism in Egypt could be explained by the fact that the beneficial Nile flood occurs when the sun is in Leo. In the Roman world, however, the lion symbolized cleansing fire; the water that poured through the wild beast's mouth was therefore pure and fit for either drinking or lustration purposes.
A thermostatic system
This rather unsophisticated design corresponds to a simple but ingenious system. The whole surface of the table top is taken up by three cavities: the outer two are round and concave to hold the large, porous clay jars with their convex bases; a pipe system connects these cavities to the central, quadrangular one, which collects the seepage from the jar walls. The water thus collected flows through a little pipe and out of the lion's mouth into a container placed on the ground. Evaporation was caused by the jars' porosity, ensuring that the water they contained was kept cool and fit for consumption.
The containers
The jars themselves are ordinary wheel-thrown vessels. Their chief interest lies in the fact that they were found during excavations in a stratigraphic context that was too disturbed by the Nile floods to allow any certainty regarding date. Their pink-colored paste suggests they were made in Aswan, and the Arabic inscription in black ink (""to my master"") on one of them allows us to establish a ""terminus ante quem"" (latest possible date for their manufacture): the second half of the 7th century at the earliest. It is difficult to assert that they were made to hold water, especially as they were probably imported, perhaps containing wine from the Aswan region, but archaeological objects often metamorphose during the course of their long lives.The Copts probably used a ladle to draw water directly from the jars. During the subsequent period, however, scrape marks at the bottom of some basins suggest that water was taken from the container itself by means of a cup.

Between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC, Phoenician craftsmen disseminated original anthropomorphic terra-cotta masks throughout the Mediterranean region. The masks may have been used during religious ceremonies or theatrical performances, and were also placed in tombs to protect the deceased from the demons of the otherworld.
A fine example of a Carthaginian terra-cotta mask
In the late 9th century BC, the Phoenicians founded, in present-day Tunisia, a ""new town"" called Qart Hadasht, which the Romans corrupted to Carthage. This life-sized terra-cotta mask was discovered during 20th-century excavations of the necropolis. It depicts a grimacing figure with decorative discs on its forehead and cheeks. Lines are drawn to represent wrinkles. The term ""mask"" is used by archaeologists to refer to plastic representations of the face with openings for the eyes and usually for the mouth. These masks were common products made by Phoenician craftsmen. They were widely distributed in the Western world and are found in Greece, Cyprus, Sardinia, North Africa, and Spain. 
The various types of mask
The oldest discoveries in Carthage were male masks, like this one. ""Grotesque masks"" and ""grimacing masks"" are frequent, and the grimacing group is the bigger. The two groups date to the 7th century BC and were produced until the 2nd century BC. Although the first group used forms and techniques that quickly became obsolete, the grotesque features and standardization of the grimacing masks were accentuated as time went on, displaying remarkable technical skill, as can be seen by the holes for adding jewelry and the flat curves around the mouth to emphasize the grimace. 
The function of the masks
The openings for the eyes and mouth suggest that the masks were produced to be worn by living beings. Some are life-sized and may have been worn by priests or worshippers during religious ceremonies. That may be the case, for example, of the masks found in Cyprus and those in the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, Greece. Other, smaller masks may have been placed on dummies and statues. The masks found in tombs, such as this one, are frequently thought to have had an apotropaic function: masks in a funerary setting were there to protect the deceased by frightening away demons.

This pillar fragment comes from a building constructed east of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. It represents the face of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten, in the easily-recognizable Amarna style. In the early years of his reign, the Pharaoh imposed the monotheistic cult of the god Re, whose visible manifestation on earth was the sun-disk, Aten. At the same time, he changed his name from Amenophis to Akhenaten.
From Thebes to the new city of Akhetaten
Amenophis IV, the son of Amenophis III and his favored queen, Tiy, came to the throne of Egypt in 1372 BC and reigned for seventeen years. After spending four years in Thebes, the city of his predecessors, he built a new capital, Akhetaten, in Middle Egypt. Amenophis IV made the new city the center of an official religion devoted to the god Re, who communicated his beneficent power to Earth via the rays of the sun-disk, Aten.In the early years of his reign, Amenophis IV ordered the construction of a sanctuary dedicated to the sun falcon, Re-Horakhty, east of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. The immense peristyle courtyard featured pillars decorated with colossal images of the Pharaoh, in the so-called ""Osirian"" pose: standing, legs together, with arms crossed on the chest and a royal scepter in each hand. The portrait is a fragment from one of these pillars.
A new artistic style
The figure corresponds closely to its architectural setting (this was a colussus carved on one side of a pillar), and respects the conventional pose and attributes of the Pharaoh. Its style and inscriptions, however, distinguish it from all other classical royal portraits. It is easily identified as a work in the Amarna style, corresponding to the reign of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten.Several documents record that the Pharaoh himself drew up new stylistic rules for his sculptors to follow. The new canon is represented perfectly here. The Pharaoh's body is no longer that of an athlete, expressing the power of his function; on the contrary, the shoulders are wide but flat; the chest is almost feminine; the waist high and narrow; the hips thick and wide, and the stomach low and round. The face is also typical of the new, more naturalistic tendency: the features are defined by straight, angular lines and flat surfaces, contrasting with softer, rounded forms. Its elongated shape is accentuated by a false beard that extends down to the chest.
The sun-god
The portrait's subject is identified by a number of cartouche inscriptions. The hieroglyphics do not mention the Pharaoh by name, but refer instead to the god he represented on Earth: ""Re-Horakhty appeared on the horizon as Shu, who is in the disk."" This colossus therefore represents the Pharaoh and his dynasty as the divinely-appointed incarnation of the sun-god.

This elegant, smiling marble angel is carrying two cruets, intended to hold the water and wine used during mass. It comes from the altarpiece given to the abbey of Maubuisson c. 1340 by Queen Jeanne d'Evreux, one of the greatest patrons of her time. The refinement of the sculpture presages the conventions of courtly art. 
Jeanne d'Evreux
In 1326, Jeanne d'Evreux married the king of France, Charles IV the Fair (who died in 1328). She was one of the key patrons of the 14th century, commissioning major art works, such as her Book of Hours, illuminated by Jean Pucelle (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Circa 1340, she commissioned a large marble altarpiece for the high altar of the Cistercian abbey of Maubuisson (near Pontoise). It was in this abbey that, in 1370, she had Jean de Liège erect a tomb for the remains of her husband as well as her own. Like Mahaut d'Artois, she exemplifies the decisive role played by women in art patronage to that period.  
The reconstruction and symbolism of the altarpiece
Individual sculpture was developing at the time and carved altarpieces enjoyed considerable success, becoming larger and more complex. The Maubuisson altarpiece is an impressive example.Although it was dismantled during the French Revolution, the composition of the altarpiece is known because it was described by the abbot Guillaume Milhet in 1763. It was approximately three meters long, with The Last Supper in the center (church of Saint Joseph des Carmes), flanked by four reliefs (Louvre): on the left, Moses, King David, and a Prophet, then Christ giving Communion to St. Denis in prison; on the right, Three Prophets, then the Angel Carrying Two Cruets. The altarpiece also included the now lost figures of Charles IV, Jeanne d'Evreux, and their daughters Blanche and Marie. The custom of representing patrons in the work - which in the 13th century was common only for stained-glass windows - was now spreading to sculpture. No doubt the white marble figures were set against a black marble background as was customary at the time.The symbolism of the Eucharist is strongly accentuated. At the center is The Last Supper - the meal during which Christ instituted the sacrament of Holy Communion. On the sides, both forms of the Eucharist are symbolized: the wine represented by the angel carrying the cruets, the bread by the Communion of St. Denis. 
A refined angel
In some respects (the elongated silhouette accentuated by the long robe, the curly hair lifted back from the face, the calm expression), this smiling angel is still a thirteenth-century figure, similar to the angels in the abbey of Poissy. But a new desire for elegance and joyfulness shows through as well: an amice of fine fabric adorns the collar, the cloth of the robe is lighter, a cord at the waist gathers the material into fine folds. The delicate, small face has an affinity with the precious arts. Evrard d'Orléans was a sculptor, painter, and architect for the French royal court and a leading artist in Paris in the first half of the century. Because of similarities between these reliefs and works executed by Evrard d'Orléans for the cathedral of Langres in 1341, the altarpiece has been attributed to him: there is the same powerful neck, straight nose, and flat hands with no fingernails.

This work can be dated back to 1624-26, to the beginning of the artist's brilliant Caravaggist period when he was part of the Utrecht school. It is an allusion to the world of the theater (antique costume) and possibly an allegory of hearing or vanity (the vanities of music and pleasure). There is a copy in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum that was famous for a long time, but its reputation has now been usurped.
Actor or buffoon?
The upper half of a young man's body is set against a neutral background; he is playing the lute. Hals has placed him within a very tight frame, which makes it seem as if the figure is emerging from the picture. Thus there is a heightened impression that the lutist is moving, accentuated by the fact that his head and shoulders are twisted in the opposite direction. The character's identity is uncertain. Is he simply a musician on tour? Does he play a buffoon as his very jolly appearance might have us believe? Or is he a theatrical figure as indicated by his fantasy costume, which is both elegant and archaic (sixteenth century)? 
A genre portrait
A wide, mischievous, perhaps ironic smile lights up the whole of the lutist's face, giving it enormous life. The natural spontaneity that the picture exudes is undoubtedly due to the fact that the artist studied a real man, the same model who is found in several other of his pictures. However, this is not strictly speaking a portrait, although Hals became famous for these too. Portrait commissions were restricted to the upper classes of society-the nobility, the middle classes, or perhaps men of letters who had themselves painted in conventional, rather static poses. The portrayal of ""little people"" from the lower classes-peasants, merry drinkers, or loose women-obviously did not have the same purpose of social recognition. In fact these pictures, which belong to what are known as genre portraits, were often the means of making a moral judgement on the pleasures of the senses and their attendant dangers. Thus this lutist might well be an allegory of hearing or a lesson about the vanity of music, which by definition is ephemeral.  
The artist's Caravaggist period
This genre portrait, half realistic and half allegorical, resembles similar subjects treated by the followers of Caravaggio in Utrecht. The method of illuminating a figure by means of a strong light from the side that molds the contours and gives them relief was typical of Caravaggio's style and the movement that followed it. However, there is no evidence that the Master of Haarlem had any direct contact with artists like Hendrick Terbrugghen (1588-1629) or Gerrit van Honthorst (1590-1656). The stylistic similarity is probably explained by the vogue for this type of picture that was current throughout Europe. But Hals differs from his contemporaries, with their rather stereotyped representations, bringing great vitality to his picture. Great colorist that he is, he emphasizes the play of brightness on the blacks and reds by introducing golden highlights. The lutist, with his dynamism, heralds that lightness and freedom of touch that was to culminate with the famous Bohemian (Musée du Louvre, MI 926). The artist's Caravaggist period was short (from 1620 to around 1625) but brilliant, and it brought his work to prominence during the nineteenth century, leading him to be seen as a forerunner of Édouard Manet.

The Rampin Horseman is a masterpiece of Archaic art, which blends Attic seriousness with the rich decorative tradition of eastern Greece. The head, which is original, is placed on a mold taken from a fragmentary equestrian group in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. The identity of the horseman is uncertain. We appear to be in the presence of a hero or a member of the Athenian aristocracy-unless the crown of leaves that he wears is a victory prize awarded in one of the Panhellenic games.
The Rampin Horseman
This male head, which was found on the Acropolis in 1877, was sculpted around 550 BC. It was purchased by Georges Rampin, who left it to the Louvre in 1896. Ten years earlier, a body of a horseman and fragments of a horse had been found on the Acropolis; they were excavated from a ditch that was dug to hold statues that were broken during the sack of Athens by the Persians in 480 BC. It was not until 1936 that the English archaeologist Humphry Payne connected this head with the equestrian group in the Acropolis Museum in Athens (molds of the group have been added to the Louvre's presentation of the head). The asymmetrical neck, which is unusual in sixth century BC sculpture, is explained by the fact that the group is thought to have comprised two horsemen forming a pair.
An uncertain identity
The identity of the horseman is uncertain. For a long time, the hypothesis of a second horseman encouraged the notion that it was dedicated to Hippias and Hipparchus, the sons of Pisistratus, whose names predestined them to horseback riding. Horses (in Greek, hippos) were a privilege reserved for members of the aristocracy. The monument would have been erected after the return of the tyrant to Athens in 546 BC. It was thus supposed that the group was a depiction of Castor and Pollux-equestrian heroes frequently pictured on vases between 550 and 510 BC-without necessarily ruling out the Dioscuri or the Pisistratidae as subjects. An examination of the fragments has shown that they belonged to other horses, disproving these hypotheses. If this is an ex-voto, then it would not feature two people but one-the Rampin Horseman was one among many such offerings dedicated on the Acropolis by horsemen. They showed the winner in a horse race cheered by the crowd, which he acknowledges by a turn of his head. This new interpretation would explain the presence of a crown of lovage in the horseman's hair; this species of wild celery was used to crown winners in both the Nemean Games and the Isthmian Games, which were held in Corinth.
A masterpiece of Archaic Athenian art
The execution of the Louvre's head is masterful. It is sometimes attributed to the ""Rampin Master,"" the sculptor of the Athens kore wearing a peplos (530 BC; Acropolis Museum). The two pieces feature the same Attic concept of the face: the triangular structure is framed by high cheekbones and a pointed chin, and the face is welcoming, animated by almond-shaped eyes and a gentle smile. Nevertheless, the Rampin Horseman blends sobriety with richly decorative hair ornamentation. The thickness of the beads, the fringe consisting of small rolled plaits, and the beaded work on the beard show the influence of eastern Greece, which spread to Athens via Ionian immigrants fleeing Asia Minor and the Persian threat. Red and black polychrome, partially preserved, adds to this sense of refinement.

359,Smiles,"<i>Portrait of Lisa Gherardini</i>, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, known as the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (the <i>Joconde</i> in French)",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo?selection=44860,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-portrait-de-lisa-gherardini-epouse-de-francesco-del-giocondo-dite-monna-lisa-la-gioconda-ou-la-jocon.jpg?1527831862,"
This portrait was doubtless started in Florence around 1503. It is thought to be of Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine cloth merchant named Francesco del Giocondo - hence the alternative title, La Gioconda. However, Leonardo seems to have taken the completed portrait to France rather than giving it to the person who commissioned it. After his death, the painting entered François I's collection.

	Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco Giocondo
The history of the Mona Lisa is shrouded in mystery. Among the aspects which remain unclear are the exact identity of the sitter, who commissioned the portrait, how long Leonardo worked on the painting, how long he kept it, and how it came to be in the French royal collection.
	The portrait may have been painted to mark one of two events - either when Francesco del Giocondo and his wife bought their own house in 1503, or when their second son, Andrea, was born in December 1502 after the death of a daughter in 1499. The delicate dark veil that covers Mona Lisa's hair is sometimes considered a mourning veil. In fact, such veils were commonly worn as a mark of virtue. Her clothing is unremarkable. Neither the yellow sleeves of her gown, nor her pleated gown, nor the scarf delicately draped round her shoulders are signs of aristocratic status.

	A new artistic formula
The Mona Lisa is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait. The painting is generous enough in its dimensions to include the arms and hands without them touching the frame. The portrait is painted to a realistic scale in the highly structured space where it has the fullness of volume of a sculpture in the round. The figure is shown in half-length, from the head to the waist, sitting in a chair whose arm is resting on balusters. She is resting her left arm on the arm of the chair, which is placed in front of a loggia, suggested by the parapet behind her and the two fragmentary columns framing the figure and forming a ""window"" looking out over the landscape. The perfection of this new artistic formula explains its immediate influence on Florentine and Lombard art of the early 16th century. Such aspects of the work as the three-quarter view of a figure against a landscape, the architectural setting, and the hands joined in the foreground were already extant in Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly in the works of Hans Memling. However, the spacial coherence, the atmospheric illusionism, the monumentality, and the sheer equilibrium of the work were all new. In fact, these aspects were also new to Leonardo's work, as none of his earlier portraits display such controlled majesty.

	An emblematic smile
The Mona Lisa's famous smile represents the sitter in the same way that the juniper branches represent Ginevra Benci and the ermine represents Cecilia Gallerani in their portraits, in Washington and Krakow respectively. It is a visual representation of the idea of happiness suggested by the word ""gioconda"" in Italian. Leonardo made this notion of happiness the central motif of the portrait: it is this notion which makes the work such an ideal. The nature of the landscape also plays a role. The middle distance, on the same level as the sitter's chest, is in warm colors. Men live in this space: there is a winding road and a bridge. This space represents the transition between the space of the sitter and the far distance, where the landscape becomes a wild and uninhabited space of rocks and water which stretches to the horizon, which Leonardo has cleverly drawn at the level of the sitter's eyes.

This moving portrait of a boy with an aged Florentine patrician disfigured by rhinophyma - acne rosacea - may in fact have been painted after the death of the latter: the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm has an excellent Ghirlandaio drawing showing the same man full face, with his eyes closed and apparently on his deathbed. The painting may also have allegorical significance. 
A dual portrait
An old man seated by a window holds in his arms a child whose delicate features are framed by blond ringlets. The man's gentle, benevolent smile and the child's trusting gaze convey their mutual affection. At the same time there is a striking difference in the way each is portrayed: shown in three-quarter view, the old man, recognizable as a Florentine patrician by the cappuccio on his shoulder, is shown with uncompromising realism, the light coming from the right enabling the painter to detail the gray hair, the wart on the forehead, the wrinkles around the eyes, and, especially, the nose deformed by rhinophyma. This image of age and the unsightliness induced by disease is in total contrast with the unsullied profile of the child, with his narrow nose and dainty mouth. 
An intimate atmosphere
Beginning with Fra Filippo Lippi 50 years earlier, the device of the window opening onto a meticulously detailed landscape - originally borrowed from Flemish painting - had often been employed by Florentine portraitists. The luminous red of the old man's fur-trimmed robe and the child's doublet and hat contrasts sharply with the gray of the pietra serena sandstone walls.The tight framing of the scene and the touching intensity of the looks being exchanged add to the intimate atmosphere suffusing this dual image of grandfather and grandson. But is this really a portrait from life?   
A commemorative painting?
A handsome drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum shows the same old man with the same disfigured nose, lying eyes closed on what seems to be his deathbed. The artist may have used this meticulous study to meet a request from the deceased's descendents for a commemorative work on wood. Thus the child is not necessarily the old man's grandson, but perhaps an invented being introduced to render the scene more narrative and poignant, in addition to highlighting the ancestor's goodness and greatness of soul.Ghirlandaio's exceptional skill and his ability to capture personality in his frescoes and paintings on wood earned him a host of commissions from the Florentine aristocracy of the late 15th century.

The Louvre's only drawing known with certainty to be by Grünewald, this sheet is full-face portrait bust of a woman whose distinctive physiognomy seems surprising. Her shoulders are bare; she has a double chin, and the lower part of her face is slightly asymmetrical. Her thin lips, deep dimples, prominent brows, and a high forehead covered by a veil that encircles her head are also characterizing elements that Grünewald takes in.
The ""German Correggio""
A mere thirty or so drawings by Grünewald survive, most of them preparatory studies for paintings. They can be divided into two groups: studies for group compositions and details drawn from live models. The almost systematic use of black chalk, occasionally with white highlights, has earned him the nickname the ""German Correggio."" As in this drawing, Grünewald, unlike Dürer, is indifferent to firm delineation of his figures' contours. His skill as a draftsman reveals itself in an apparently capricious hatching and the varying intensity of the lines. For example, the nervous, repeated lines on the woman's head-covering on the left is countered by the subtlety of the medium's use in enveloping the left eye with concentric circles and helping to define volumes.
A pioneer in the art of depicting human faces and expressions
The artist focuses his attention on the character's face, making the most of her unusual features. The bare shoulders and neck are less finished. The woman's small eyes are half-closed, and she is glancing down to the right. The expression of this woman, who is smiling slightly, becomes still more enigmatic because the sole source of light, above the model and to her left, underlines the slight asymmetry to the lower part of her face. Her unusual, even odd, features are reminiscent of two other studies of women with folded hands, one in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the other in the Oskar Reinhart collection in Winterthur, which are both preparatory drawings for the Issenheim Altarpiece, the artist's major work, dated between 1512 and 1515. The same model must have posed for all the drawings. It is also worth noting that while Dürer sought to capture the truth of the sitter by indicating his social status, particularly in the portraits dating from his time in the Netherlands (1520-21), Grünewald was more interested in depicting the inner life of his models.
From realism to forms of expressionism
The evident similarity with the drawings in Oxford and Winterthur and equally obvious stylistic affinities with two studies for a St. Sebastian (Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden, and Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin), that are linked beyond doubt to the Issenheim Altarpiece, would seem to indicate that this drawing dates from between 1512 and 1515. While Grünewald, following in the footsteps of Leonardo da Vinci, was a pioneer in the study of human physiognomy, his desire to render human expressions as faithfully as possible led him sometimes perilously close to ugliness and distortion. For example, two studies of heads of a crying child (Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin) in preparation for the St. Alban retable in Mainz cathedral (no longer extant) depict anguished, painful expressions. They illustrate a fundamental tendency in German art in the first half of the 16th century, a turn towards violence apparent as well in two studies of rogues by Lucas Cranach, also in the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin.

This is a rare example of a drawn portrait attributed to Holbein the younger. It is a head-and-shoulders portrait of a young woman shown almost face-on. Her hair is plaited and a few locks have come free. She is wearing a gown that covers her shoulders. Along her corsage is an inscription in abbreviated German: ALS. IN. ERN. ALS. IN. (All in honor or In all honor). Around her neck she wears the insignia of Saint Anthony, probably an amulet to protect her from the plague.
The ""German Mona Lisa""
The confident, precise line of the metal point models the curve of the shoulders and the cheeks of this young woman, who is looking down. Her head is slightly to one side and her glance from beneath partly lowered eyelids is modest. Her discreet, mysterious smile is reminiscent of that of the Mona Lisa. While the linear style is similar to that of the artist's father, Hans Holbein the elder, there is a new sensitivity in the expression and a gift for observation that prefigure the portraits in three colors that the artist was later to produce in England.
An anonymous portrait?
While the realism of the drawing suggests that Holbein was working from a live model, the identity of the subject remains a mystery, although a number of hypotheses have been put forward. Some commentators have suggested that the woman's eyes reveal the early signs of the eye disease that afflicted Holbein's wife, Elsbeth Binzenstock, as recorded in the touching painting Portrait of the Artist's Wife and Two Eldest Children, now in the Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basel. Holbein had the idea for this painting after his first visit to London in 1528-29. Other commentators have suggested that the model is the same as for the Lais Corinthiaca, also in the Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basel, although this interpretation is less convincing.
A characteristic technique
Whatever the truth about the model's identity, the technique combining metalpoint and red chalk highlights is characteristic of the artist's early career. Following the religious upheavals that shook Basel, he spent a short while in France in 1524, where he certainly developed an admiration for the works of Clouet. He then took up the technique using three colors, typical of the portraits he produced during his two later stays in England. In the case of this portrait, the touches of white gouache on the bridge of the nose, the corners of the mouth, the lower eyelids, the corners of the eyes, above the eyebrows, and to the left of the nose give the woman's face a certain softness. The work is a preparatory study for the Solothurn Madonna, commissioned by Johann Gerster, clerk of the town of Solothurn, and completed in 1522. (This painting is now in the town museum in Solothurn). This woman appears in the painting, which combines the Gothic tradition and aspects of the Italian Renaissance, in a slightly different position, with her head held high and a less apparent smile.

This statue of a misshapen nude dwarf with overly long arms, bowed legs, and a face combining leonine and human features is the god Bes. Despite his rather unattractive appearance, he was a benevolent deity, and protected people during vulnerable periods by keeping malevolent spirits at bay. He was a particular favorite among pregnant women.

Description
Bes is portrayed standing atop short legs, his hands resting on his upper thighs, sticking out his tongue at the viewer. Only the lower part of his headdress remains; it has a hole, perhaps for attaching feathers. His hybrid face features imposing eyebrows carved in relief and a broad nose. It is flat, with jowls that disappear into a generous beard that spirals down on either side of his mouth. The position of the deeply set eyes suggests that they may have held inlays, as did the tongue. The two small, round ears with tufts of hair are those of a lion. He is clad in a lion pelt carved in light relief that falls from his shoulders to his round buttocks. The lion's tail is clearly visible. The small head of a feline appears on his torso, its front paws on his shoulders; the back paws on his upper thighs. The beast's mane on his back forms the shape of a wig. A serpent's body, knotted around his navel serves as a belt. 
You can't judge a book by its cover
Bes's repulsive and even terrifying appearance put all harmful spirits to flight. He was extremely popular and was portrayed often. His image decorated the wall of certain rooms of a house such as the bedroom. It also appeared on beds and headrests, where he watched over people as they slept. His image was also used on certain toiletry objects, including mirrors and recipients for cosmetics and unguents, to increase their protective powers. His most important role, however, was to watch over woman throughout their entire pregnancies and during childbirth, just as he watched over the birth of the sun god.He danced and played the harp, the tambourine, and the pan pipes, while making faces: all this noise and his grimacing drove away troublesome spirits. During the Late Period, he became a formidable composite god. He was also invoked in temples where he would send dreams to worshippers in response to their questions. He was a deity with multiple powers and was also considered to be a healing god.
Mariette discovers Bes and brings him to Paris
Auguste Mariette discovered this statue in 1851 during excavations at Saqqara, as he was searching for the Serapeum. It was one of some 5,000 objects unearthed by the French Egyptologist and given by Egypt to France, where it joined the collection of the Louvre Museum. It was found on the ground below its base in the court of a temple dedicated by King Nectanebo II to Apis, south of the Serapeum. Mariette had it put back on the base and observed a procession of workers and residents who came from the nearby villages of Abusir and Saqqara. He noted the different reactions to this discovery: ""It is noon, and when the sun accentuates the already expressive features of Bes; the Egyptians take it for the devil, the women curse it, the men spit on it, and a few 'Negro' workers ran away, roaring with laughter.""""

This crippled Neapolitan beggar is holding a paper authorizing him to beg, which reads in Latin: ""Give me alms for the love of God."" He takes pride in having his portrait painted by the artist and his picture indeed has the monumental size and dignity of a prince's likeness. He stands against a clear and luminous sky, a token of Ribera's evolution during his period of maturity under the influence of the masters of Bologna.
A portrait of a beggar
In a landscape with vast skies overhead stands a beggar with a clubfoot (a deformed foot, which no longer rests on the heel). In all likelihood a dwarf - as implied by the painting's title before it entered the collections of the Louvre, The Dwarf - he faces the viewer with a gap-toothed grin. His crutch slung over his shoulder like a weapon as if to amuse the spectator, he seems proud to have caught people's attention. In his hand, he also holds a paper on which the following line is inscribed in Latin: ""Give me alms for the love of God."" This is to inform us not that he is mute, but that he has the right to beg. Such a paper was a sort of permit required of beggars in Naples. Some have interpreted these lines as an appeal to Christian charity in the spirit of the Counter Reformation, which liked to recall the necessity of practicing acts of mercy. It is probable, however, that Ribera's main intention here was simply to paint the portrait of a beggar. He had a fancy for humble figures from the poorer populace, like Caravaggio before him. He also shared with his fellow countryman Velázquez a more specific interest in cripples and dwarfs.
A commission from a Flemish dealer
Ribera painted this picture in Naples in 1642. Contrary to long-standing belief, it appears not to have been commissioned by the viceroy of Naples, Duke of Medina de las Torres, but by a Flemish dealer. Flemish painters had accustomed their countrymen to representations of beggars (The Beggars by Brueghel the Elder, Louvre, r.f.730) and Flemish dealers ordered paintings of this kind from other Spanish artists as well, particularly from Murillo (The Young Beggar, Louvre, Inv.933). Born in the region of Valencia, Ribera left Spain for Italy very early. He resided at first in Rome, where he took up with the followers of Caravaggio. In 1616, he settled in Naples where he stayed until his death in 1652. Very soon, he became the town's most sought-after painter, concentrating on religious compositions in which he attached great importance to the representation of old and ailing bodies.
Luminosity and monumentality
This piece belongs to the period of Ribera's maturity during which he evolved from a Caravaggesque tenebrism to a luminous style under the influence of the masters of Bologna (Annibale Carraccio, Guido Reni) and of Venice (Titian). In this full-length portrait of a beggar, he has presented his subject close up and from a low angle so as to endow him with dignity and make him appear monumental. He would not have painted a king or a saint any differently. As in the period when he was influenced by Caravaggio, Ribera chose here to bring out the plasticity of forms by contrasting shadow and light on the face and hands. However, the beggar stands againt a backdrop that is no longer the dark background of the Spanish painter's earlier pictures, but a landscape over which a bright sky unfolds. The canvas is filled with an almost natural light. Contrasting with the vibrant blue of the sky, the figure of the beggar is painted with a limited palette of muted colors. Ribera's brushwork is loose.

In the middle of a feast, Pierrot at upper right, Pulcinella in the center, and Mezzetino on the left are startled to see the benches they are sitting on shoot into the air. The same device elevates the laden table as well. Scaramouch tumbles over as masked Harlequin threatens him with his torch. On the right, a woman looks back as she leaves. This farce, or ""lazzo"", was apparently inspired by a comedy performed at the Théâtre Italien in 1670, Arlequin, Esprit Follet. 
Arlequin, Esprit Follet
Etched by Huquier with three other studies for the Livre de Scènes Comiques Inventées par Gillot, this drawing shows a scene from Act II of Arlequin, Esprit Follet. This anonymous play, attributed to Cinthio and performed in March 1670 by the Italian players at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, was later presented at the St. Germain fair. A second version of the etching, illustrating the same scene, was sold at Sotheby's (London, 30 June 1986). The comedy tells the story of Isabella, who wants to marry Octavio; her father will not agree to the marriage and promises her to Cinthio. Harlequin, a sprite conjured up to serve Octavio by a magician, tricks Octavio, his valet, and Isabella's father. When they go into a cabaret, Cinthio and his servant are faced with the sprite Harlequin, who says he will bring them ""a table with glasses that rise into the air and dishes that run; there is a firecracker in the pie; the table runs off and the two seats do likewise"".
On the fringe of reality
After the Comédie Italienne was closed down in 1697, the play was performed during the fairs held at St. Germain and St. Laurent. Fairground plays were very popular at the time and inspired Gillot. His characteristic pen and red chalk wash and lively hand have captured this scene from the commedia dell'arte. Gillot's technique is ideal for conjuring up the ""piazzia"", or madness, characteristic of the harlequinade. The low angle places the viewer at stage level. Corrections and sometimes squaring indicate that the drawing is not as unfinished as it first seems. Although Watteau and Lancret depicted players from the Comédie Italienne in a festive, bucolic setting, it was Gillot who emerged as the real artist of the Commedia dell'arte, readily using the subtle art of improvisation and sketching the players unawares. 
A theater lover
Gillot is one of the artists at the end of Louis XIV's century for whom theater was more than just a subject - it becomes a sort of religion, taking the place of fables and the pious or secular tales of history painting. Far from being a speciality of the French school, however, such scenes had already been illustrated by Jacques Callot and Le Clerc. Gillot provides us with a snapshot of the theater, a real stage showing the players in action, the sets, and sometimes even the boards. His approach is distinct from that of his pupil Watteau, whose theater scenes are reconstructions based mainly on Italian comic types and do not refer to an actual performance. In 1712, Gillot, who had been admitted to the Académie two years earlier, was asked to supervise the sets, machinery, and costumes for the Paris Opera; only a few engravings of these ephemeral creations survive.

Between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC, Phoenician craftsmen disseminated original anthropomorphic terra-cotta masks throughout the Mediterranean region. The masks may have been used during religious ceremonies or theatrical performances, and were also placed in tombs to protect the deceased from the demons of the otherworld.
A fine example of a Carthaginian terra-cotta mask
In the late 9th century BC, the Phoenicians founded, in present-day Tunisia, a ""new town"" called Qart Hadasht, which the Romans corrupted to Carthage. This life-sized terra-cotta mask was discovered during 20th-century excavations of the necropolis. It depicts a grimacing figure with decorative discs on its forehead and cheeks. Lines are drawn to represent wrinkles. The term ""mask"" is used by archaeologists to refer to plastic representations of the face with openings for the eyes and usually for the mouth. These masks were common products made by Phoenician craftsmen. They were widely distributed in the Western world and are found in Greece, Cyprus, Sardinia, North Africa, and Spain. 
The various types of mask
The oldest discoveries in Carthage were male masks, like this one. ""Grotesque masks"" and ""grimacing masks"" are frequent, and the grimacing group is the bigger. The two groups date to the 7th century BC and were produced until the 2nd century BC. Although the first group used forms and techniques that quickly became obsolete, the grotesque features and standardization of the grimacing masks were accentuated as time went on, displaying remarkable technical skill, as can be seen by the holes for adding jewelry and the flat curves around the mouth to emphasize the grimace. 
The function of the masks
The openings for the eyes and mouth suggest that the masks were produced to be worn by living beings. Some are life-sized and may have been worn by priests or worshippers during religious ceremonies. That may be the case, for example, of the masks found in Cyprus and those in the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, Greece. Other, smaller masks may have been placed on dummies and statues. The masks found in tombs, such as this one, are frequently thought to have had an apotropaic function: masks in a funerary setting were there to protect the deceased by frightening away demons.

This vase was made circa 470 BC. Although it uses the shape and decorative composition of Attic red-figure amphorae from the early fifth century BC, the black-figure technique is conserved, together with the archaic kneeling-running position - cleverly adapted here to portray the dancer as she swirls to the rhythm of the crotalum. The Etruscan painter made skillful use of line and curve to render the folds of the clothing, bringing the dancer to life and creating the illusion of space.
A fondness for archaic conventions
The front of this black-figure amphora is decorated with the figure of a woman dancing to the rhythm of the crotalum; on the back is the figure of a goat. The painter was reluctant to break with solutions inherited from the Greek art of the sixth century BC. He used the black-figure technique (replaced by the red-figure style in Athens starting in 530 BC) and the kneeling-running position. The rendering of the body still followed the Archaic formula: the head and legs shown in profile, the torso depicted frontally. The clothing is also represented in archaistic style: the short cloak resembles those worn by certain sixth-century figures, but is draped in folds like the peplos, which came into fashion in 480 BC.
Attic models as a source of inspiration
Although this amphora dates to the late Archaic period (circa 470 BC), its painter strove to break with sixth-century BC conventions by taking his inspiration from the Attic red-figure vases produced in the early fifth century BC. The form and decorative syntax are borrowed from Athenian models, which were massively imported into Etruria at that time. This influence is particularly evident in the concern with rendering space; the impact of the Archaic style - which did not share this concern - is thus considerably lessened. The face and legs are portrayed in profile, but the torso is slightly twisted - this is suggested by the strongly sloping shoulder line. The impression of depth is enhanced by the superimposition of planes, and the way the dancer's clothing disappears behind her bent knee. The painter also sought to convey her movement through the oblique lines on the clothing, whose folds follow the curves of the body.
A work by a painter from Vulci
The artist to whom this work is attributed was dubbed the ""Painter of the Dancer with a Crotalum"" because of the scene depicted on the front of this vase. He probably learned his skills from the Micali painter, who was active in Vulci between the sixth and fifth centuries BC. The shape and decorative syntax of the amphora, together with certain characteristics of the drawing, were features of the artist's later work.

This gilded silver bottle decorated with elegant female dancers is typical of Sassanid metalwork. It hints at the sumptuous luxury of royal and religious feasts during the Sassanid era. Sassanid art was heavily influenced by the traditions of antique Greece, Rome, and Iran. In turn, it was an important influence on the art of medieval Europe. Sassanid fabrics and silks in particular were widely copied. 
Figures of young female dancers
The bottle has a rounded, egg-shaed body decorated with a ring of beads round the neck and gilding on the body. The neck, the foot, and the motifs in relief are not gilded. The body is decorated with four female figures who dance in procession, one foot lifted and arms spread wide. They are holding branches of foliage or birds. The women are wearing a close-fitting, transparent tunic which covers their arms but hugs their bodies. They wear a pleated cloak draped over their elbows, its horizontal folds partially hiding their legs. The wind playing with the hem of the cloak gives a lively impression of movement. The dancers are slender of torso but have generously rounded hips. They are holding their heads to one side, which adds to their charm. Are they professional dancers at a royal celebration, like the sensual female musicians in the Bishapur mosaics? Or was the celebration of the exuberance of nature intended as a form of worship of the goddess Anahita? 
A taste for costly tableware
Such bottles are typical of Sassanid metalwork. Other known examples include numerous platters decorated with scenes of royal hunts or battles, as well as ewers and gadrooned dishes. These precious pieces of tableware were doubtless used to serve guests at celebratory and religious feasts. Their iconography is either royal or religious in nature. Sassanid art remained remarkably constant in style from the 3rd to the 6th century AD and across a vast area - pieces similar to this have been found in Iran, Central Asia, and Anatolia. The Sassanids were not alone in their taste for costly tableware. Antique records yield a number of other examples, including the inventory of the possessions of King Zimri-Lim of Mari in Syria in the 18th century BC, an account of the Assyrian king Sargon II's pillaging of the city of Musasir in the 8th century BC, and the depictions of servants carrying such objects on reliefs in Assyria and Persepolis. 
From the Orient to Europe
Sassanid artists produced mosaics, stucco work, precious fabrics, stamps, and costly tableware, inspired by the Greek and Roman traditions, as well as the art of antique Iran. In this case, the detail of the cloak curving in a graceful arch is borrowed from the nymphs typical of Eastern Roman art, while the generous curves of the dancers and the birds are more typically Oriental. At the same time, a few details look forward to the art of medieval Europe. The wind puffing out the garments of the dancers foreshadows the Roman tympanums of Autun cathedral or the basilica of Vézelay, just as the heavily armored knights on horseback fighting with lances which figure in the cave reliefs of Bishapur and Taq-i-Bustan prefigure the warlike images of feudal Europe. Many of these stylistic features reached Europe in the form of motifs on the embroidered fabrics and silks, used to protect religious relics sent back from the Orient to the churches of Europe. It is moving to think that Europe was familiar with the classical heritage thanks to such objects from Persia, well before the rise of Islam and the Crusades.

Clio, the Muse of history, is holding the trumpet which heralds the great events of human history and the book in which they are recorded. Euterpe, the Muse of music, is playing the flute and is wearing a floral wreath. Thalia, the Muse of comedy, is holding a mask in reference to the theater. 
A homage to Italian Mannerism
The scene is set in a delightful landscape that is both intimate and realist. The three Muses are grouped in the center. The colors are remarkably refined. The yellow, pink, and blue of the gowns of the three figures echo the green foliage and the gray-blue sky. Le Sueur's painting is a homage to Italian Mannerist painting.
The Muses and the arts
In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. Each Muse represented a different art. Clio represented history, Euterpe music, Thalia comedy, Melpomene tragedy, Terpsichore dance, Erato elegy, Polyhymnia lyric poetry, Urania astronomy, and Calliope epic poetry and eloquence. Their cortege was led by Apollo, who inspired their creations. This painting had a companion piece depicting Melpomene, Erato, and Polyhymnia. The Cabinet of the Muses in the Hôtel Lambert was also decorated with individual renditions of Urania, Terpsichore, and Calliope. The ceiling was decorated with the scene from Greek legend when Phaeton asked Apollo to let him drive the chariot of the sun.
The Hôtel Lambert
This elegant and brightly colored painting, along with four other paintings by Le Sueur dating from around 1650, was part of the decoration of the Cabinet of the Muses at the Hôtel Lambert. This elegant mansion on the Ile Saint-Louis in Paris belonged to Lambert de Thorigny, president of the Court of Accounts, who regularly called on the services of a number of artists, including Le Sueur. The mansion was designed by Le Vau. The interior was richly decorated. Apart from the Cabinet of the Muses, Le Sueur also worked in the Cabinet of Love, where he painted another famous series of works. Both the Cabinet of the Muses and the Cabinet of Love were saved by Count d'Angiviller in 1776 when they became part of the royal collections.

The picture was meant to be hung above a mantelpiece, hence the figures (in old-fashioned theater costume) shown on a balcony. One of Honthorst's first paintings, it is in the neo-Italian and illusionist style that would prove so successful for him. 
A joyous concert
Five women comfortably installed on a kind of stone balcony are giving a concert. Three singers are reading from sheet music while the two musicians accompanying them improvise the melody, as was customary at that time. The musician on the right is playing the lute, and the one on the left an archilute or bass lute, whose complex chords were greatly appreciated. The singers are gazing down at their scores, intently following their lyrics, while the two lute players are smiling fetchingly at the viewer. The boisterous musical exuberance of the two opulent, rosy-cheeked beauties is echoed by the picture's clear, bright colors. 
Theatrical trompe-l'oeil
Red damask curtains have been theatrically drawn to reveal the musicians. Their brightly colored clothes, which Honthorst borrowed from 16th-century Burgundian theatre as the Venetian painters had done, add to the overall gaiety. The scene is depicted very realistically in sotto, i.e seen from below. These artifices are designed to create a trompe-l'oeil opening above a fireplace. It is thought that this musicians' gallery, formerly in the stadtholder's collection, was part of a décor. The balustrade on which the lute player is sitting was probably a continuation of the mantelpiece, which would explain the upward looking viewpoint.  
""Gerrit of the Night""?
Honthorst, who was born in Utrecht, spent around ten years in Rome, where he very probably saw works by Annibale Caracci, whose Bacchus and Ariadne (Palazzo Farnese) inspired the two graceful cherubs. But he was above all influenced by the Caravaggist painters, as were his fellow countrymen Ter Brugghen and Baburen. Honthorst retained Caravaggio's predilection for working class characters in theatrical costumes portrayed from the waist up. But here he abandons the somber palette which in Italy had earned him the nickname Gherardo della Notte (Gerrit of the Night) and plays on a chromatic scale of light, bright colors, setting the tone with electric blue and pale yellow and a few striking notes of bright red. This adaptation of the Caravaggio esthetic to a Nordic spirit and a fondness for musical subjects and ample-bodied beauties is typical of the ""Utrecht Caravaggists"".

This picture, an early work by Gainsborough, shows the impact of French art, a dominant influence in England at this time. The scene falls into the category of the conversation piece, a genre characteristic of English art in the eighteenth century and particularly popular in its first half.
A seduction scene exhibiting various influences
The iconography of this picture is fairly simply. A young man, sitting on a bench next to a young woman, holds a book in his hand. The man is a young aristocrat (as can be deduced from his sword) and is clearly in the midst of courting his companion. The setting is typical for a Gainsborough painting, with a bench and a wooded background.Gainsborough often painted couples. However, these young people seem somewhat stiff, more like puppets than actual people, and the whole picture brings together the most conventional aspects of seduction scenes in painting. He seems visibly agitated, with his legs crossed and his right hand stretched out towards his companion. The young woman in her pastel-pink dress, on the other hand, who seems scarcely to respond to the young man, appears more composed, her face turned towards the painter.This painting is indicative of the influence of French art on English aesthetics in the eighteenth century. Works by Watteau, Philip Mercier, and Nicolas Lancret quickly became known in England, especially as they were reproduced in engravings.Gainsborough's talent for landscape painting is apparent here in the romantic, wooded background that frames the scene. Gainsborough's technique consisted of applying colors in one simple layer; he also mixed his paints with more oil than was usual, thereby increasing the luminosity of the canvas.
A typical conversation piece
The ""conversation piece"" began life in the 1720s. The genre adapted the French Rococo conventions for portraiture, but was mainly a response to the renewal of English artistic and cultural life in the eighteenth century. It rapidly became very popular. The genre allows an informal portrait to be made of a group of people, with figures usually presented to the viewer in a more spontaneous manner instead of being depicted in traditional poses.
Gainsborough: a countryman in London
Gainsborough made a name for himself very quickly in London, where, at the age of twenty-one, he was invited to exhibit alongside the most famous names of the time. He was a student of Hayman and Gravelot, a French draughtsman who had settled in London, and he opened his first studio in 1745. After moving to Suffolk, Gainsborough began to concentrate on landscape painting. The genre took up much of his time in the studio and outdoors, although he continued to paint portraits. In 1777 he painted his first portraits of the royal family, and in 1783 he was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy.

This bronze helmet, richly decorated with a Gorgon's and a griffin's head, was probably used by Thracian gladiators during the parades preceding the games in the amphitheater at Pompeii, just before Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. The shape of the visor, which evolved over the course of the first century, is typical of the period. The eye openings have been replaced by a grill covering the upper part of the face, and plume holders have been added on either side of the helmet.
Armor discovered at Pompeii
This bronze helmet is one of a number of pieces of armor given in 1802 to the First Consul Bonaparte by Ferdinand IV, king of Naples. They were buried when Vesuvius erupted and the region of Naples was laid waste on 24 August, AD 79, but saw the light of day when excavations were carried out (1766-67) in the gladiators' barracks at Pompeii. They were kept at Malmaison until the death of Josephine and thereafter entered the Durand collection (1814) and the Comte de Pourtalès collection (1825), before being purchased by the Musées Impériaux in 1865. Finally, they were transferred to the Louvre from the Musée des Antiquités Nationales at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1892. The armor, which is richly embossed, was probably used in the parades that preceded the games in the arena.
Part of the armor used by the ""Thraces"" and the ""Mirmillones""
Several examples of highly enveloping helmets of this type have been found at Pompeii. They were part of the equipment used by the most heavily armed gladiators - those from the northeast of Greece, the ""Thraces"" (Thracians), and those from Gaul, the ""mirmillones"". The shell of the helmet is highly rounded, with a broad brim, and has a crest decorated with overlapping plumes and terminating in a griffin's head. This mythological creature was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of fate, who was venerated by gladiators (there was often a chapel dedicated to her inside the amphitheater). On the front of the helmet, the silver-plated head of the Gorgon Medusa stands out. On either side of the helmet are plume holders to which feathers were attached. The face and neck of the gladiator were protected by a movable visor made up of four riveted plates, two of them solid, the other two pierced.
The evolving shape of the gladiator's helmet
To judge from its shape, that of the visor in particular, this helmet would seem to have been made in the decades preceding the catastrophe of 79 AD - between 50 and 75 AD. The shape of the helmet worn by Thracian and ""mirmillon"" gladiators evolved considerably over the course of the first century AD. At the end of the reign of the emperor Augustus (27 BC--AD 14), the cheek plates were replaced by a visor with openings for the eyes. The rim of the visor was narrow and only slightly curved at the sides. A little after the middle of the century, the rim became broader and more curved. The eye openings were then replaced by a protective grill covering the upper part of the face. By the end of the first century, this protective grill had evolved to cover the whole surface of the visor, which it now replaced. The gorget surrounding the helmet became narrower, closely following the lines of the visor to form a right angle on either side of the face.

The stand of this perfume burner features a young woman dancing to the sound of the crotalum, perched on a tripod in the form of lion's paws. The graceful movement surging through her body is prolonged by the disproportionately long hands, inviting the spectator to take part in the dance. Music and dancing played an important role in Etruscan ceremony.
An incense burner with a figurative stand
This bronze incense burner is evidence of the vogue for small luxury items that was widespread in Etruria throughout the archaic and classical periods. The burner was made in the early fifth century BC, using a solid-cast lost-wax technique. A tripod in the form of a lion's paws resting on rondels supports a circular top on which a dancer moves to the sound of the crotalum. Her clothes are engraved with fine, circle- and star-shaped designs. Resting on the head of the statuette is a cylindrical stem embellished with six sconces and terminating with a fleuron.
An invitation to join in the music and dancing
The impulse that sweeps through the young woman's body and the graceful movements of her arms and legs appeal directly to the spectator to join in the music and dancing that accompanied Etruscan ceremonies. The artist has deliberately exaggerated the proportions of the hands, so as to give greater fullness to the gestures.
A creation of the Vulci workshops
It is not known precisely where this censer comes from, nor where it was made, but it is generally considered to have been produced by a bronzefounder in Vulci, in central Etruria, because of the similarity of the statuette to figurines on candelabra and censers made at Vulci during the same period. Most of these stand on similar tripods, composed of three lion's feet resting on rondels. Furthermore, the craftsmen of Vulci were renowned during the archaic period for their production of bronze tableware and other moveables, the stands for which were often adorned with animal or human figurines.

The painting depicts the annual parade organized by the Dutch guild of butchers and its highlight, a prize-winning ox, wearing a floral garland. Note the important detail of the glasses on the animal's rump. The painting also refers to the brevity of human existence; the ox is happy but will shortly be slaughtered for meat.
A Carnival tradition
Philips Wouwermans chose as his subject one of the popular celebrations of the final days of the Carnival, the parade with a fatted ox. A fatted ox or bull was led through the streets of the town before being slaughtered on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent. One of the finest oxen was chosen for the parade, and garlands of flowers and leaves were hung around its neck. The parade was also a reminder of the frailty of human life, as the ox was the star of the parade one day and slaughtered the next. In Holland, the parade was organized by the butchers' guilds. Here the impassive ox is being led through the streets by two butchers, as indicated by their aprons.
A joyful parade
This popular subject allowed Wouwermans to depict a number of amusing figures. A joyful escort noisily heralds the arrival of the ox: at the head of the procession is a musician dressed in bright red playing a drum, along with a little boy holding a hoop. The parade has attracted a crowd of onlookers, including many children. There is a peasant doffing his cap, a woman with her young daughter, a man on horseback with his little boy behind him, and a young scamp scared off by the huge size of the ox. It is easy to imagine the din that must have accompanied the procession-dogs barking, the banging of the drum, and drunken butchers bawling songs. Note that two glasses perch on the rump of the ox, while one of the butchers is knocking back a third glass.
An artist with many talents
Philips Wouwermans is the best-known member of a family of painters from Haarlem. He studied under the great artist Frans Hals and learned to imitate his master's rapid, nervous brushstrokes. This painting is the perfect illustration of Wouwermans' many talents. He was a genre painter who excelled at depicting figures with distinctive expressions and also horses. During his career, he painted many scenes of cavalcades-the white horse in this work is a fine-looking beast-as well as landscapes. The figures are drawn with fairly precise, elegant lines, while the rendering of background of houses and a little bridge over the river shows a lighter touch. The pale golden tones of the background are influenced by artists such as Pieter van Laer, known as Il Bamboccio, who were themselves inspired by the Italian style. The painting as a whole recreates the carefree atmosphere of unrestrained pleasure that must have reigned during such Carnival celebrations.

This portrait of a poetic, dreamy Pierrot is an exceptionally large painting for Watteau. It may have been a sign for a café belonging to a former actor by the name of Belloni. The stock Commedia dell’Arte characters in the lower part of the painting give it an enigmatic air.

	A sad clown

	The easy fluidity of the brushwork and the bright colors make this work a real masterpiece. It has often been seen as a self-portrait in which the artist portrays himself as a sad clown. It has proved very difficult to determine whether the figure of Pierrot is a portrait taken from life—perhaps one of Watteau’s friends or a well-known actor—or an allegory drawn from the artist’s imagination. The work draws its dramatic power from the moment of stasis in the action, the heavy immobility of the central character, and the viewpoint chosen by the artist, looking up at Pierrot from below.

	The Italian Comedy

	This painting was formerly known by the title Gilles, but nowadays the title Pierrot is preferred as being closer to the theme of the work. In fact, the subject is far from clear. Is it a theatrical sign for a café or a fairground show? Was the work commissioned or did the artist paint it simply for pleasure? The character of Pierrot takes up almost the entire painting, standing out against the sky, while the characters from the Commedia dell’Arte are painted in half-length, hidden behind foliage. Four stock characters can be identified—the doctor on his donkey, the lovers Leandro and Isabella, and the captain.

	The Louis La Caze donation

	The work belonged to Dominique Vivant Denon, director of the Napoleon Museum during the First Empire, before it was acquired by Dr. Louis La Caze, a keen collector of 18th-century art. Louis La Caze bequeathed his artworks to the Louvre in 1869, and they form the basis of the museum’s collection of 18th-century French painting.

Celebrated by artists for centuries, the decoration of this sarcophagus illustrates the ideal of the cultivated man as manifested in Roman funerary art of the second to fourth centuries CE. Each of the nine Muses is endowed with a distinctive attribute. According to  a belief attested in Greece as early as the fourth  century BCE, the practice of literature and the arts under the inspiration of the Muses eased the passage of the dead into the hereafter and ensured the salvation of their souls.
A source of inspiration for modern artists
The Sarcophagus of the Muses has long been held in great esteem by artists. Aquila's engravings, reproduced in Lord Coleraine's album, did much to ensure its fame in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has also served as a source of inspiration to later painters and poets: in 1911, Pierre Vuillard included it in his painting ""La Bibliothèque"" (Musée d'Orsay, Paris), and it inspired the first of Paul Claudel's ""Cinq Grandes Odes.""
The significance of the Muses in funerary art
By the early second century CE, burial had taken the place of cremation, and the Romans began to make use of sarcophagi decorated in relief, firstly with garlands - a motif borrowed from first-century funerary altars - and later with narrative scenes. Some of these evoked the life of the deceased: this is no doubt the case with the banquet depicted on the lid against a draped background. Generally, however, artisans turned to Greek mythology, drawing an implicit connection between the subject chosen and the beliefs of the deceased. The decoration of this sarcophagus illustrates one of the ideals found exemplified in Roman funerary  art of the second to fourth centuries CE: that of the cultivated man, the ""mousikos aner"" in Greek, represented in portraits of Socrates and of the poet Hesiod (or perhaps Homer). According to  a belief attested in Greece as early as the fourth  century BCE, the practice of literature and philosophy, or daily intercourse with the Muses, ensured immortality and the soul's salvation. The nine Muses, daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (Memory), are depicted on the front, each with her distinctive attribute. From left to right they are Calliope, the muse of epic poetry, who holds a scroll; Thalia, muse of comedy, holding a comic mask; Terpsichore, muse of dance; Euterpe, muse of lyric poetry, holds a double flute; Polymnia, muse of hymnody, leans on a rock; Clio, muse of history, has a writing-tablet; Erato, muse of love poetry, holds a cithara; Urania, muse of astronomy is shown with a globe at her feet; and finally Melpomene, muse of tragedy, wears a tragic mask.
The Influence of Greek Art
Created around the mid-second century CE, this sarcophagus was probably made for a cultivated Roman anxious to demonstrate his attachment to Greek culture, with models drawn from Greek art. The composition of the frieze, the neutral background and the retrained attitude of the Muses all evoke the classical art of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. This impression is sustained by the very discreet employment of the drill and the rounded forms of the carefully polished surfaces. The elongated figures of the young women and their almost statuesque appearance, suggested by the depth of the relief, also recall Hellenistic art.

The picture, painted late in the artist's life, around 1635-38, is manifestly neo-Bruegelian in inspiration. The pig's snout poking out of the sty on the right is an ancient symbol of gluttony (gula). According to those who date the picture in the 1620s, the landscape was painted before the figures, which are in Rubens' late lyrical style. 
A Flemish tradition
This monumental picture, also called the Village Wedding, is in the northern tradition of depictions of village fêtes. Pioneered by Pieter Bruegel, the enormous popularity of this genre contributed to the renown of the Flemish School. These compositions often had a moral message, denouncing the baseness of the human condition by showing it in all its excesses. However, even though a pig's snout - a symbol of gluttony - can be seen poking out of the sty in the foreground, denouncing vices was not Rubens' main preoccupation.
A frenzied farandole
The subject was actually used by Rubens as a pretext to compose a skilful interplay of forms and colors expressing all the exuberance of a village fête, with old and young enjoying themselves alike. The feast is being held in front of a farmhouse painted in shades of brown, perhaps as part of a wedding or to celebrate the end of the harvest (there are sheaves of wheat in the foreground). The composition is organized around the long triangle of revelers dancing their frenzied farandole. The succession of dancing couples forms waves of arabesques that seem to form one continuous movement. The overall swirling effect is emphasized by the many curves echoing one another. Rubens depicts rustic joie-de-vivre and the pleasures of the senses in an extraordinarily varied gallery of characters. He has fun showing peasants fooling around like young puppies, drinking and eating (sometimes even directly off the ground), children guzzling away at the breasts of ruddy-cheeked women, and fleeting couples abandoning themselves to the games of love. This dizzyingly exuberant life contrasts with the opening onto a peaceful landscape beneath a serene, luminous sky, which was possibly painted earlier.   
A brilliant, rapid technique
The picture was painted around 1635-38, during the artist's late period, when he was at the height of his powers and glory. Rubens gives his audacious painting rhythm with rapid touches of bright color that he deliberately makes no attempt to conceal. The picture entered Louis XIV's collection in 1685. Its virtuoso technique and sense of color inspired numerous French painters, including the famous painter of ""fêtes galantes"" himself, Watteau.

Board games were very popular in Egypt and the Near East. They exist in several variants, with cells or holes for the pieces. The Near Eastern material, often incomplete, can be understood through the data from Egypt. This example of what is called ""the game of 58 holes"" was discovered in Necropolis B at Tepe Sialk in Iran, and it is the form of board game most frequently found in that country. With its wide geographical and temporal distribution, the basic game developed into several versions.
The ""game of 58 holes""
The modern terms for these ancient board games most often derive from the game board itself, as for instance ""the game of 20 squares"" or ""the game of 58 holes."" The latter refers to the two tracks of 29 positions marked by holes, laid out symmetrically on the board. The players, each provided with five pegs and dice, had to reach the finish, a common end-point, by moving their pieces along their respective tracks. Some of the positions have inlaid motifs or inscriptions, and some are connected together, marking particular stages in the progress along the board. Other names for the game refer to the form of the board (the shield game), or its decoration (the palm-tree game) or to the pieces (the game of dogs and jackals, at the Louvre, N 42645). The game is also found in different versions, from the Luristani game (AO 25342) to the Egyptian (N 3043).
Use in divination
The board and its pieces were not used only for playing games. They might also be used in divination and in funerary rituals. The throw of the dice or knucklebones, which determined the movement of pegs or pawns, would in these cases be taken as an expression of divine will. Board games figured in the deposit at the Temple of Inshushinak at Susa (Louvre Museum, Sb 2911 and Sb2912), very likely testifying to the role of the god Inshushinak, a judge of the dead, in divination.
Necropolis B at Tepe Sialk
This game board, without accompanying pieces, comes from a pillaged tomb in Necropolis B at Tepe Sialk. The archaeological material is unfortunately often incomplete, not only because some pieces were perishable, but because others were not identified as such. The Near Eastern material can be explained by reference to data from Egypt, where relevant texts and images and the games themselves have all survived better, thanks to the climatic conditions. Necropolis B yielded a quantity of Iron Age funerary equipment, including very fine painted and lustered ware, parts of harness, and other items connected with games: knucklebones (AO 18077) and a medallion imitating the ""game of 58 holes"" in miniature. Games were a choice funerary offering to accompany the deceased on his journey to the hereafter.

The painting dates from about 1663 to 1665, the early years of the artist's Amsterdam period. The card game is a pretext for amorous flirtation. Note that the woman, doubtless of easy virtue, has cheated and is holding all the aces.
The game of love
A couple is sitting comfortably in front of an imposing marble fireplace, playing a game of cards. A young servant is approaching rather timidly with a carafe to refill the glass of a third figure, who is talking to the young woman card player. In the background, a couple is taking advantage of the golden shadows to enjoy a moment of intimacy. Without a doubt, the scene is set in a house of pleasure where young men could discreetly enjoy the company of accommodating young ladies. Here, love is a game that may be cheated at like any other, as the hand proudly displayed by the beautiful courtesan-four aces-seems to suggest.
The art of perspective
During his time in Delft, from 1653 to 1663, Pieter de Hooch was deeply influenced by the color and strict lines of the art of Carel Fabritius, who also influenced Vermeer. However, he developed a personal style that proved a success, basing his compositions on a colorful, artful use of perspective, with figures fitting harmoniously into the overall scheme. His works are subtly illuminated with lateral sources of light and often feature a series of rooms leading from one to the next. The lines of the marble floor tiles draw the viewer's attention to the vanishing lines of the painting. The spatial elements opening onto the exterior-windows and half-open doors-are punctuated by a contrasting play of light, accentuating the lines and volumes.
A painting from the artist's Amsterdam period
Pieter de Hooch left Delft to settle in Amsterdam in about 1663. The new surroundings led him to experiment with a different style and new subjects. He gradually left behind the intimate scenes of daily life of his Delft period, such as the Woman Preparing Vegetables in the Back Room of a Dutch House, also in the Louvre, moving on to works depicting the contrived luxury of the homes of the wealthy bourgeoisie. The splendor of the garments worn by the elegant figures is matched by the richness of the setting, with the red-and-blue marble fireplace, the rich fabric of the exotic tapestries, and the walls hung with gilded leather skins. The range of Pieter de Hooch's inspiration was expanded by the succession of worldly, flirtatious scenes, but his talent as a colorist is as delightful as ever. The intense scarlet and gold colors of the courtesan's satin and brocade gown are picked out in details elsewhere in the composition: in the decorative gilded leaf patterns on the walls, the young beau's cape, and the Oriental rug in the background. These brighten the softer shades of green, blue-gray, and ochre that give the scene such delicate nuances of light-similar, though in a different vein, to the poetic use of light in the art of Vermeer.

Double-sided gaming board comprising a 64-square black and white chess board, and a trictrac or backgammon board featuring a dark green ground and four central lozenges containing profile portraits. The boards are framed with sixteen elongated panels decorated with elements derived from Classical trophies. An object of considerable refinement, dated and signed by Léonard Limosin, the board is first recorded in a private collection in the mid-XIXth century. Its earlier provenance is unknown.
The games
Precursor of the XIXth-century game jacquet (in French) or backgammon (in English), trictrac is the XVIIth-century French name for the medieval game 'tables', itself a descendant of the Roman game Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum ('Twelve-lined Game'). The 'tables' are the round tokens used in the game (similar to today's draughts). The checkerboard is the familiar support for the game of chess, which originated in northern India in the Vth century AD. Introduced to western Europe by the Arab conquerors of southern Spain, chess enjoyed a veritable renaissance throughout the West in the XVth century. Both games involve moving tokens or chess pieces across the boards, and the fine condition of this piece indicates that it was probably intended for decorative use only. This is the only known example of a gaming board using the Limoges technique of painted enamel; however, an enamel trictrac board is mentioned in the inventory of the estate of the Duc de la Meilleraye, chief artillery officer and Maréchal de France (Field-Marshal) in 1664.
The work of Léonard Limosin
Léonard Limosin's first dated works are a number of religious plaques made in 1533; a signed plaque depicting the legend of Psyche, in the Louvre collections, is dated 1534. His first enamelled portrait, of François I's second wife Eleanor of Austria, is dated 1536. Limosin's prolific output includes pieces dated as late as 1571. This gaming board is a particularly fine example of his genius: note the harmonious tones of the grisaille elements against the green ground of the surrounding framework; the finesse and originality of the gold motifs decorating the white squares of the checkerboard and the spaces between the points of the trictrac game; the refinement of the busts decorating the latter's central field.

The ""St Louis"" chess comes from the Crown collection, but the tradition attributing it to Louis IX of France is certainly mistaken. This set, made of rock crystal and smoked quartz, was in fact created in the late fifteenth century in Germany (the board) and France (the pieces). Extensively altered over the centuries, it nevertheless remains a fine example of the artistic inventiveness of the fifteenth century and of the magnificence of the French Crown collection.
A chess set of crystal, quartz, and silver
The board is composed of thirty-two squares of rock crystal alternating with thirty-two squares of smoked quartz, all cased in silver. Each square of rock crystal is backed with a silver foil bearing a silver flower with red enamel petals and green enamel leaves. Similarly, each square of quartz is backed with a black foil adorned with a gilt silver flower with leaves of silver. These flowers are thus visible through the opaque squares. Half of the pieces, which are not all original, are carved from rock crystal (the white pieces), and the other half (the black pieces) from smoked quartz. Each piece is six-sided, carved from a single block and mounted in gilt silver.
A chess set within a chess set
Arranged around the periphery of the board's sixty-four squares are eight small compartments covered with rock crystal lids. Inside are little boxwood figurines, both civilian and military, seated, standing or on horseback. Painted red or blue, they seem to echo the chessmen. On two of the sides, the tiny figures occupy the squares of a reduced chessboard of white and black metal. Each of these sixteen-square boards is framed by two bouquets of silver flowers on a ground of imitation greenery, which also appears inside two other compartments containing soldier figurines represented in a forest. The military figures are modeled on German soldiers of the late fifteenth century, suggesting that the board was made in southern Germany.
The chess set: modifications and history
In 1791 the sides of the board were still embellished with gilt copper on a ground of blue enamel. Now the sides are plated with a stamped silver frieze of foliage added in the nineteenth century. The corners rest on the heads of chubby winged cherubs in gilt bronze dating from the seventeenth century. Added in the eighteenth century, these may be of Italian workmanship. Royal inventories often listed chess sets made of semi-precious stones. The presence of the little boxwood figures links this set with others listed in inventories as belonging to the Palais du Louvre. This set was listed in the inventory of the collections of Gabrielle d'Estrées (1573-99), and later in the gem collection of Louis XIV under number 31. As one piece was lost, Louis XVIII gave the set to his first valet de chambre, Thierry de Ville-d'Avray.

This cup testifies to the popularity of circus games and their representation in late Antiquity. African potters used this theme widely, with a preference for chariot races. Here we see the charioteer standing upright in a chariot pulled by a team of four horses. Dressed in the distinctive garb of his profession, he is holding the palm of victory, and brandishes the victor's coronet. This relief decoration was created using a technique typical of North African ceramic workshops.
A work from North Africa
This terracotta cup comes from a North African workshop, where it was made sometime in the fourth or fifth century AD. Featuring three grooves running around the inner rim, and lacking a base and handles, it belongs to a series of vessels produced in great numbers throughout the Mediterranean basin, but originating in what is now Tunisia. The inner medallion is decorated with low-relief motifs, which were molded separately and then applied to the clay - a procedure characteristic of ceramic workshops in this region of the Roman empire. 
A victorious charioteer
The decoration consists of a single figure: a victorious charioteer standing in his chariot, pulled by a team of four horses. The compositional conventions of the fourth century AD are very much present, particularly in the disproportionate sizes of the charioteer and his four horses, and of the charioteer's own head and body. The horses and their driver are represented frontally, as was the norm in Late Antiquity. The man is dressed in the standard outfit of charioteers: a helmet and tunic, with additional protection in the form of long-sleeved padding held in place by leather straps. He holds a palm frond at his side, and brandishes the triumphal crown, the symbol of victory, in his right hand. Two palm fronds beneath this scene serve to balance the decoration and reinforce the symbolism of victory. 
The popular iconography of victory
Very early on, ""circus games"" became extremely popular in the Roman world, inspiring a rich and varied decorative repertoire that was used in every artistic domain, but particularly ceramics, sculpture and mosaics. Games and sporting events appear as a theme in Roman African art in the first century AD, and became a favorite subject for mosaicists and local potters. From  the third century AD onwards, chariot races became enormously popular throughout the Roman empire, particularly in North Africa, and were widely depicted in art. The figure of the victorious charioteer takes pride of place among the various motifs used on sigillated (stamped) ceramics and countless commemorative mosaics. The image might recall a real-life triumph, or simply signify good fortune. The latter interpretation seems most appropriate here: in contrast with most other examples, there is nothing to place the driver and team within the context of a hippodrome.

This discus thrower is a reproduction of a lost bronze original, made by the Greek sculptor Naucydes at the beginning of the fourth century BC. The work adheres to the canon of ideal beauty proscribed by Polyclitus (fifth century BC) for an athlete at rest. Here, however, action is imminent, and the work goes well beyond the example of Polyclitus. Naucydes portrays the athlete as he is about to throw the disc; the concentration in his face and the contraction of the toes reveal his tenseness.
Portrayal of an athlete about to stand for the throw
This statue of a discobolus, or discus thrower, was part of the collection of antiquities at the Villa Borghese in Rome, where it stood with three other athletes around the Gladiator, which entered the Louvre at the same period - around 1808, when Napoleon Bonaparte purchased the collection from his brother-in-law, Prince Camillo Borghese. The athlete is portrayed adjusting his position, in the instant prior to hurling himself forward for the throw. He looks down (the head is a modern addition by the sculptor Pacetti), concentrating on the accuracy of the coming throw. Tension in his body is shown by the curve of the back, the way the left hand is held back, the fingers gripping the discus, the contraction of the toes of the right foot, and the energy of his stance, with both feet firmly on the ground.
A replica of the Naucydes discobolus
This type of representation is attested by several other Roman copies agreed to be replicas of a bronze work, now lost, attributed to the Greek sculptor Naucydes of Argos. According to Pliny the Elder (Natural History, XXXIV, 80), Naucydes made a statue representing a discus thrower. The original probably dated from the beginning of the fourth century BC, when the artist was at the peak of his career. A follower of the school of Polyclitus of Argos, Naucydes remained faithful to the teaching of his master, as can be seen in this work.
Renewal of the classical heritage
The classical heritage is present here as a series of echoes of works from the fifth century BC, modified by a new approach to the representation of athletes. The discus thrower preserves many of the features of the work done in the middle of the fifth century by Polyclitus - the idealized aesthetics and canonical forms, the apparent calm of athletes at rest. The musculature is treated in thick, clearly defined masses, as in the Doryphorus and the Diadumenus (a Roman copy of which is in the Louvre); the anatomical aspect is governed by the same quest for harmony and by an equally skillful calculation of proportions. This goes considerably beyond the model proscribed by Polycletus. The athlete is now part of real space, suggested by the imminence of movement and by the attitude of the young man, which goes beyond the ""contrapposto"" developed by Polycletus.

The ancient Egyptians left much evidence of the games they played. This game board, however, is unique, both in its novel hippopotamus form and in the sophistication of its material, a fine faience inlaid with brilliant colors. The back of the board has the fifty-eight holes used for playing a game that was popular throughout the whole of the ancient Middle East.

	""Dogs and jackals,"" the game of fifty-eight holes

	The Egyptians were enormously fond of games played on checkerboards, of which they had several, one being the famous game of senet. A number of boards have been found for playing the present game: they always have two symmetrical tracks of twenty-nine holes, in which the pieces were placed. The two larger hollows at the sides must have been used to store pieces or knuckle-bones; pieces which had gone all the way round were placed in the two holes on either side of the eyes of the hippopotamus.
	The two players’ pieces were distinguished by their heads, one set having upright ears (jackals?), the others ears turned down, hence the modern name of “dogs and jackals.” The pieces here do not belong to this board, although they too are old. The original pieces must have been much more refined in execution.

	The rules of the game

	Specialists have been able to reconstruct the rules of the game by examining the numerous surviving examples of this type of board. The two players moved their pieces forward in turn according to the throw of the knuckle-bones. The circuit begins in the middle of the back, behind the head. Landing in holes no. 10 (at the tail) and no. 20 (beside the hollow at the side) meant having to go back;  landing in holes no. 15 (at the beginning of the large lateral hollow) and no. 25 (at the end) gave an extra go. It was in fact a kind of snakes and ladders for two people.

	Luxurious board

	The “game of fifty-eight holes” appeared in Egypt in the Middle Kingdom (around 2000 BC). Boards for the game have been found throughout the Middle East, but the example in the Louvre is unique on account of the hippopotamus form (unfortunately with a jaw broken off) and the material used: light blue faience with elegant inlays. This type of turquoise blue quartz-based ceramic  is very characteristic of the craft production of the Late Dynastic Period. Much of the inlay, set in a white or red cement, has been lost. What has survived consists of a few small thin patches and lines of white, black, orange, and dark blue glass, and small white rosettes. The boldness and range of the colors—the presence of the orange in particular—suggest that this piece dates from fairly late in the Late Dynastic Period, between the 27th and 30th Dynasties, in the 6th or 5th centuries BC, when a taste for small multicolored glass inlays developed, becoming widespread in the Ptolemaic Period.

From the New Kingdom onward, the track for the game of Senet was usually engraved on the surface of a wooden box featuring a drawer for the playing pieces, while in previous periods the game seems to have been an integral part of a low table. Funerary scenes show the tomb owner seated at a tall pedestal table on which the game box is placed. On the underside of this particular box (as of many others) is a grid for the game of ""Twenty Squares"" which had recently been imported from the Near East.
The Senet board
The 30-square format remained unchanged as long as the game of Senet continued to be played; it may have inspired other games, such as the 3 x 11 square track that can be found on the back of some Senet boxes. From the New Kingdom onward, certain squares contained inscriptions. A few indications suggest that the playing pieces followed an inverted S-shaped track; the game ended with a countdown, represented by the last five squares which were often inscribed. Although the marks varied according to the game, they always had the same meaning: square 26, marked with the symbol meaning ""good,"" doubtless earned the player a bonus; square 27 (water) signified rebirth and purification, or had a negative value (like the snake in our game of snakes and ladders); square 28 represented 3 (with three jabiru birds in this instance); square 29 signified 2 (with seated figures), and square 30 (when it was inscribed, which is not the case here) represented 1—often with an image of the sun god.
The ""Twenty Squares"" board
When a game board featured inscriptions (which was not always the case), the same five squares were always inscribed with a rosette, cross, or hieroglyph. Even when not inscribed, these squares had the same implicit value. The owner's names and titles are indicated on Imenmes's game board.The markings on the board suggest that there were four stages to the game, with four squares between each stage.Some clues about the game of Twenty Squares can be gleaned from a cuneiform-inscribed tablet dating from the 2nd century BC, now in the British Museum: players were rewarded if they landed on the inscribed squares, but penalized if they did not land on them.We can assume that each player's pieces were placed on opposite sides of the central column before beginning the game; the goal was then to advance the pieces up the small side column to a first mark, then to turn left or right (according to player) and go down to the bottom of the central column (common to both players) to leave the track.
Religious meaning
From the late 18th Dynasty onward, the inscriptions on game boards became more diverse and included more complex symbols. Some Senet boards had inscriptions in each of the 30 squares. Scenes of games painted in tombs show the tomb owner facing an invisible opponent: the deceased's fate depended on the outcome of the game. This very scene is commented in Chapter 1 of the Book of the Dead.The game of Senet acquired symbolic meaning, and religious and mythological concepts relating to the world of the dead and to rebirth were developed in funerary texts. The game of Twenty Squares developed along the same lines, and its track acquired 31 squares. The deceased frequented the 30 gods of the pantheon, hoping to be accepted ""as the 31st""—a wish that could be fulfilled by winning the game of Senet or 31 Squares.

The girl must have been throwing the knucklebones with her right hand, which has now disappeared, while clasping the bag they were in with the other hand. However, the figurine, which was found in a votive context, is more than just a depiction of a woman playing and is probably connected with Aphrodite. This work, one of the earliest terracottas fully in the round, comes from Athens, and highlights the city's role in the development of the Tanagran style.
Girl playing knucklebones
The girl playing knucklebones wears a crown, a chiton, which has slipped to expose her right shoulder, and a himation, the folds of which at the back have been sculpted with great care. As evidenced by many other similar figurines, she must have been throwing the knucklebones on the ground with her right hand, which has since disappeared, while holding the bag for the knucklebones (phormiskos) with her left hand. This motif of the kneeling woman was originally confused with that of the woman picking flowers. However, this work provides evidence of an evolution when compared with early examples that came out of vase-making workshops. The back of the statuette, which is worked with great care, shows that the use of the bivalve mold had been fully mastered. Modeled in the round, the figurine has lost the strictly frontal pose characteristic of the earliest work of the mid-4th century BC.
An Attic creation
This statuette from the Campana Collection belongs to a group whose provenance has recently been reconsidered. Unlike most of the works in this collection, these fifty-three pieces were discovered not in Italy, but in the Acropolis in Athens. Comparing these works with items in the Acropolis Museum confirms this origin and proves that they were Attic creations of high quality, characterized by a highly refined orange clay, small dimensions, and elegant reliefs. The work clearly emphasizes the role that Athens played in the production of these new Tanagran motifs, which were subsequently adopted all over the Mediterranean region from 330 BC. The original treatment of the drapery, playing on the arrangement of the lines that make up the folds, and revealing both the girl's body and her action, perhaps go some way toward explaining their success.
Playful or symbolic representation?
The significance of the knucklebones, which undoubtedly had a symbolic dimension and bore witness to new practices or beliefs, may also have been a factor in their rapid diffusion. Here, the girl playing is placing herself in the hands of chance, a reference to fate and the gods that preside over it. The young girl destined to be a wife is placing herself in the hands of Aphrodite, a divinity who became more and more important from the 4th century BC onward. Indeed, the ""Aphrodite throw,"" where each knucklebone fell on a different side, was the best throw. Similarly, a girl waiting to be married was sometimes named philastragale, which means ""loving knucklebones."" If placed in the tomb of an adolescent girl, the figurine could have symbolized the thwarted fate of a future wife, who died before her time. If offered as an ex-voto in a sanctuary, it could also highlight the transition from the status of adolescent to that of married woman. The presence of real knucklebones, sometimes found in large numbers in certain tombs and sanctuaries, confirms the symbolic value of these game pieces.

This bronze helmet, richly decorated with a Gorgon's and a griffin's head, was probably used by Thracian gladiators during the parades preceding the games in the amphitheater at Pompeii, just before Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. The shape of the visor, which evolved over the course of the first century, is typical of the period. The eye openings have been replaced by a grill covering the upper part of the face, and plume holders have been added on either side of the helmet.
Armor discovered at Pompeii
This bronze helmet is one of a number of pieces of armor given in 1802 to the First Consul Bonaparte by Ferdinand IV, king of Naples. They were buried when Vesuvius erupted and the region of Naples was laid waste on 24 August, AD 79, but saw the light of day when excavations were carried out (1766-67) in the gladiators' barracks at Pompeii. They were kept at Malmaison until the death of Josephine and thereafter entered the Durand collection (1814) and the Comte de Pourtalès collection (1825), before being purchased by the Musées Impériaux in 1865. Finally, they were transferred to the Louvre from the Musée des Antiquités Nationales at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1892. The armor, which is richly embossed, was probably used in the parades that preceded the games in the arena.
Part of the armor used by the ""Thraces"" and the ""Mirmillones""
Several examples of highly enveloping helmets of this type have been found at Pompeii. They were part of the equipment used by the most heavily armed gladiators - those from the northeast of Greece, the ""Thraces"" (Thracians), and those from Gaul, the ""mirmillones"". The shell of the helmet is highly rounded, with a broad brim, and has a crest decorated with overlapping plumes and terminating in a griffin's head. This mythological creature was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of fate, who was venerated by gladiators (there was often a chapel dedicated to her inside the amphitheater). On the front of the helmet, the silver-plated head of the Gorgon Medusa stands out. On either side of the helmet are plume holders to which feathers were attached. The face and neck of the gladiator were protected by a movable visor made up of four riveted plates, two of them solid, the other two pierced.
The evolving shape of the gladiator's helmet
To judge from its shape, that of the visor in particular, this helmet would seem to have been made in the decades preceding the catastrophe of 79 AD - between 50 and 75 AD. The shape of the helmet worn by Thracian and ""mirmillon"" gladiators evolved considerably over the course of the first century AD. At the end of the reign of the emperor Augustus (27 BC--AD 14), the cheek plates were replaced by a visor with openings for the eyes. The rim of the visor was narrow and only slightly curved at the sides. A little after the middle of the century, the rim became broader and more curved. The eye openings were then replaced by a protective grill covering the upper part of the face. By the end of the first century, this protective grill had evolved to cover the whole surface of the visor, which it now replaced. The gorget surrounding the helmet became narrower, closely following the lines of the visor to form a right angle on either side of the face.

This bronze, thought at various times to be Etruscan, was probably made in the early fifth century BC in ancient Italy, by a workshop in the city of Medma, in Magna Graecia. It celebrates an athlete's triumph, and the pose, particularly the position of the fingers of the right hand, indicates that he is a javelin thrower with a leather sling used to project the missile over a long distance. The movement, though flamboyant, does not depict a precise moment in the act of throwing. 
A votive bronze depicting a javelin thrower
According to the inventory of the Royal Furniture Repository, this bronze entered the Crown collections before 1684. It was probably made to celebrate a triumphant athlete and was dedicated to a shrine. The pose, particularly the position of the right hand, suggests that the figure is a javelin thrower with a sling - a strip of leather which, wound around the index and middle fingers, enabled the missile to be projected over a great distance. The movement is flamboyant and does not illustrate a precise moment in the act of throwing: the javelin, which has since been lost, will have been directed toward the ground, as can be seen from the way it was bound to the hand. From the late sixth century BC on, bronze became the preferred medium used by Greek and ancient Italian sculptors. It was good for expressing movement (something it is difficult to achieve with marble), and it opened up previously unexplored possibilities to artists. Spurred on by the advantages of the medium, the figure of the athlete became their subject of choice in the early years of the fifth century BC.
A new sober style emerging from the archaic legacy
This statuette attests to the esthetic innovations developed by sculptors working at the end of the archaic era but before the dawn of classical art. This new generation favored a sober style. Certain of the statuette's features - the hieratic aspect, the frontal view, the young man's nudity, the conventional rendering of the outthrust left leg, longer than the right - still bear traces of the ""couros"", or Greek male statue, typical of the sixth century BC. Nevertheless, the male nude had evolved noticeably since that time. The contours, though powerful, have become more supple; the muscles, despite a few hesitations in the anatomy of the pectorals and the thighs, are well observed and rendered with greater precision (particularly in the treatment of the calves and knees). To express the athlete's movement, the artist has made use of the undulation of the back and has shifted the main line of the pectoral muscles in relation to the thorax. The hair is short, and the grave, serious face bears no trace of the becoming smile common to archaic statuary.
A work from Magna Graecia (""Great Greece"")
Identified on several occasions as an Etruscan piece, this work is now thought to be of ancient Italian origin and to have been produced in the early fifth century BC by a craftsman from the city of Medma, in southern Italy. The young man's massive proportions, with the head as broad as it is long, and the different manners in which the musculature is treated - sometimes incoherent and schematic, sometimes scrupulously observed - are all characteristic of the art of Magna Graecia. Some elements are reminiscent of the work of Pythagoras of Rhegium, a Greek sculptor settled in southern Italy who became famous for his ceremonial portraits of triumphant athletes at the Greek games.

Knucklebones, like throwsticks, featured among the accessories for board games, and were used by players to determine how far their pieces could move along the track. They were not Egyptian in origin, but were imported from the Near East from the early New Kingdom onward.
Form and material
The first knucklebones were taken from the tarsal bones of hoofed animals—but of young animals only, as with age the tarsals fuse to neighboring bones. The Egyptians preferred artificial knucklebones, carved from a variety of materials including bone, ivory, faience, and wood. These were sometimes realistic, imitating the bumps and hollows of the original object (as in this example), or on the contrary were highly simplified rectangles, barely rounded at the ends.
One of the Amarna tablets (clay tablets inscribed with Akkadian cuneiform writing that shed light on diplomatic relations between Egypt and the Near East in the second half of the 18th Dynasty) informs us that King Tushratta of Mitanni sent two games including knucklebones inlaid with gold to Amenophis III on the occasion of his daughter's wedding. 
Period of use
Knucklebones are not represented in reliefs and paintings from the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and there were none in the tomb of Hesire. They were not introduced into Egypt until the early New Kingdom, but were known in Central Europe and the Near East from the 3rd millennium BC onward. 
Game boxes for Senet and Twenty Squares contained knucklebones. Examples have been found inside the drawers of such boxes, or placed next to game tables in tombs; of the eight that were found in Tutankhamun's tomb, six were made of ivory (two of these being in the drawer) and two of resin. They have also been found in a domestic context during the excavation of houses.
How knucklebones were used
Knucklebones are shown in tomb paintings above game pieces, below the game table (see the scene on the box of Imenmes), or in the players' hands. They are often represented in pairs—perhaps one per player.In its natural form, a knucklebone has two broad, parallel faces with an undulating surface, and two narrower faces which are harder to land on when a throw is made. A specific value was no doubt attributed to each side, as in the classical world where each face was worth 1, 3, 4, or 6. 
We know of only eight scenes of games featuring knucklebones, and in seven of those the game pieces are arranged identically in two separate groups (five to the left and five to the right), rather than alternately (as was the case for Senet). The scenes showing knucklebones may mostly have represented games of Twenty Squares, in which the pieces were arranged differently than for Senet—a hypothesis supported by the fact that knucklebones arrived in Egypt at the same time as the game of Twenty Squares.

Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) came to the Spanish court in 1775. He would stay five years in Madrid, where he painted several cartoons for tapestries to be woven at the Royal Tapestry Factory for the Spanish Crown. On the whole, Goya chose plebeian, everyday subjects for them, an example of which is the Louvre's Fight at the New Inn. Its satirical approach and darkly ironic mood are characteristic of Goya's work.
A card players' brawl
In 1775 Goya delivered his first cartoons to the Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara, established in 1720 by Philip V. Most of Goya's cartoons and tapestries are today in the Prado or the Escorial. In creating his designs, the artist enjoyed a degree of freedom, and the themes he chose are illustrated using archetypal figures from everyday life. The setting of the Fight at the New Inn is a perfect one in which to assemble a variety of types. There are majas, Murcians in short trousers, and other figures, perhaps coachmen or muleteers. Having taken their rest, these last had settled down to play cards. But a fight has broken out, and while it is going on the innkeeper is taking the money abandoned on the gaming table.
A tapestry commissioned for El Pardo
Goya's tapestries were made for El Pardo, the winter residence of the kings of Spain, some eight miles outside of Madrid. In all, he painted sixty-three cartoons on popular subjects. Ten tapestries woven to these designs were hung in the dining room of Prince Carlos and Princess Maria-Luisa. Besides the Fight at the New Inn, these included the Picnic, the Dance on the Banks of the Manzanares, Maja and Cloaked Men, the Card Players, the Kite, and four overdoors. Goya's work on these led to his being presented to the royal couple, who became his patrons. It might seem surprising that these rather light-hearted popular scenes were hung in a royal palace. El Pardo was, however, a country residence, where manners were more relaxed than in the palaces of the capital.
The influence of Spanish popular theatre
The groups of figures are symmetrically distributed in a friezelike composition. The inn itself is without depth, like stage scenery, and it is possible that Goya was influenced by Spanish theater in the composition of the work. A number of plays could have served as inspiration, especially the ""sainete,"" one-act musical comedies with very simple plots, which looked satirically at the life and behavior of ordinary people. It is equally likely that his royal clients had a distinct taste for such popular theater. Its satirical and ironic vision of social life was entirely shared by  Goya, and here it is given a moralizing edge: what lies at the root of the brawl is money.

The tradition of creating statuette groups of wrestlers first appeared during the Hellenistic period. This statuette, found in Autun, France, reflects the popularity of the combat sport called pankration in Roman times. Unlike boxing, pankration called for bare-knuckle fighting. The sculptor has depicted the fighter violently kicking his opponent, throwing his own weight back so as not to lose balance. The deliberately exaggerated pose underlines the violence of the sport. 
The Autun fighter
The Louvre purchased this bronze statuette of a fighter mid-combat in 1870. The statuette had been found in Autun, in the Saône-et-Loire département, a year earlier. The fighter is standing on his right leg, kicking out violently at his opponent, throwing his chest backwards and spreading his arms wide for balance. This rather acrobatic pose invites the viewer to inspect the statuette from all sides to appreciate every detail - the energetic expression on his face, the bunched muscles, his will to defeat his opponent, who is waiting with clenched fists, ready to counter-attack. The sculptor has shown great flair in giving the man such powerful muscles, the result of long hours of intensive training. As a result, the head appears disproportionately small. The man's swollen face and cauliflower ears show that this is not his first fight. Likewise, he wears his hair slicked into a single coil on the top of his head - a hairstyle worn by Oriental or Egyptian professional fighters. In this case, this coil of hair, known as a cirrus, has been cast as a ring, which may indicate that the statuette was used as a weight for scales. 
Pankration
Our athlete is a pankration fighter. Pankration was an extremely violent combat sport that was a cross between wrestling and boxing. It is said to have been invented by Theseus when he was fighting the Minotaur in the Labyrinth in Knossos. Unlike boxing, where athletes wrapped their hands in leather straps, pankration was true bare-knuckle fighting. No time limit was set for the combat. The two opponents fought standing or wrestled on the ground, which was dampened with water or coated with oil. Only biting and cheating were prohibited by the rules. The winner was the first fighter to force his opponent to admit defeat.
The legacy of the Hellenistic tradition
The Autun statuette was made in a workshop in the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis, probably in the 1st century AD. The choice of subject reflects the popularity of pankration in Roman times. However, artists had long been inspired by wrestlers, depicting them both in pottery and in small bronze pieces. The statuette in the Louvre follows on from the artistic tradition of depicting groups of wrestlers, which began in the Hellenistic period. The over-developed muscles and the man's almost caricatured expression show that the artist was inspired by small bronze sculptures made in Egypt in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, particularly in Alexandria, where sculptors turned out both realistic and grotesque figures. These statuettes usually come in pairs, the two fighters shown in close physical combat, like two other bronze statuettes in the Louvre (Br 366 and Br 4441).

The only diurnal painting by Georges de La Tour in the Louvre along with the Saint Thomas, the Cheat illustrates a theme that was frequently taken up in the wake of Caravaggio. The young man is subjected here to three major temptations according to 17th-century moral standards: gambling, wine, and lust. Another version with notable variations is known to exist, the Cheat with the Ace of Clubs (Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum).
1972, the year of La Tour’s renaissance
One of George de La Tour’s masterpieces and a classic of French painting, the Cheat occupies a particular place among the artist’s works for several reasons. Purchased in 1926 by Paul Landry from an antique dealer on the Île Saint-Louis, the painting bearing the artist’s handsome signature, was made public by Hermann Voss, in 1931, in an article that was to deliver the artist from the depths of oblivion. In this respect, the Louvre painting is one of La Tour’s “firsts.” In 1934, the Cheat featured in the memorable exhibition of the Painters of Reality (Peintres de la réalité) that brought French 17th-century painting back to glory and marked the revival of Georges de La Tour. This sparked a growing craze for the artist and the corpus of his works broadened. Lastly, the year 1972 saw the first monographic exhibition devoted to the painter. It was a huge success and, on this occasion, Landry donated the work to the Musée du Louvre.
The fleecing of the young man
Four figures are gathered around a table and are playing cards. They all seem to be suspended in time. On the right, a lavishly dressed man is going through his cards. He is set apart from the other figures and does not share in their complicity, which is visible in their sidelong glances. Slightly off-center, a woman with a sophisticated hairstyle and plunging neckline beckons us with her eyes and hand position toward the left side of the composition where another player, plunged in shadow, is discreetly producing an ace of diamonds from under his belt. To complete the scene, a maidservant is preparing a glass of wine between him and the courtesan. The situation seems quite clear. The young man, drawn into the game by the courtesan not lacking in assets, is intoxicated and will be divested of his possessions by the man on the left. The painting reworks a subject introduced by Caravaggio in a work currently in the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the companion piece to the Fortune Teller in the Louvre by the same artist. A canvas similar in subject painted by La Tour (Metropolitan Museum, New York) formed the pendant to the composition in the Louvre, or more probably to an earlier version of it, also in Forth Worth.
Dialogues with the 20th century
In the simplified volumes, the oddness of the composition, and the comical aspect of the subject matter, the Louvre’s Cheat found pride of place in 20th-century sensibility. It is easy to imagine how this work must have fascinated the Cubists in its treatment of mass or the Surrealists with its mysterious character, as did another painting a few years its predecessor: Gabrielle d’Estrées and One of Her Sisters, an anonymous work from the second school of Fontainebleau (Louvre).

This picture from a prestigious source (Cabinet Choiseul, 1771) is in the style of a ""bambocciata"" (a realistic portrayal of Italian low life with many small figures). It has an Italianate feel, with its lyrical, idealized light. It is among the most sophisticated of Dujardin's works, with larger figures than usual. The picture's true subject has perhaps still to be deciphered (a lesson on vanity?), adding to its charm and appeal.
A game of morra or vain boasting?
Against a background of Roman ruins, a beggar and a soldier are deep in conversation, under the attentive gaze of a fair-haired young boy and a servant who has come to bring them a dish of meat. Perhaps the picture is about the game of morra, where chance is combined with strategy. The game was fashionable in contemporary Italy and was often depicted by Dutch painters. To win, each participant had to guess correctly the number of fingers that all the players would simultaneously hold up. But the picture's subject might also be an exciting story being told by the man in white, and listened to with rapt attention by the young woman and boy. As for the soldier, he is not taken in by this vain boasting: he is openly confiding in the onlooker through the well-known amusing gesture he is making, which invites us to share his incredulity. 
A ""bambocciata""
The picture was undoubtedly painted in Amsterdam in the 1660s, for it was during this period that the artist developed the habit of introducing classical features into his backgrounds. For example, the porphyry Roman sarcophagus was inspired by the very famous one that was then in the Pantheon (it was moved in the eighteenth century to St. John Lateran to contain the remains of Pope Clement XII). In this composition, Karel Dujardin is working in the ""bambocciata"" style popular with artists like Sébastien Bourdon and Jan Miel. The ""bambocciata"" was a type of painting featuring an everyday scene of Italian low life or peasant life. It was made fashionable by Pieter van Laer, who was nicknamed Il Bamboccio. But although Dujardin uses the dark colors typical of this genre, his Caravaggio-style chiaroscuro has enormous power, giving the figures a sculptural presence which is rather rare in his work.  
A lesson on vanity?
The picture may be more than a popular representation of a game or a braggart's tale, and may have a deeper meaning. The sculpted medallion on the left depicts Hercules, a virile allegory of Strength. Perhaps he is set in contrast to the beautiful Venus, the feminine goddess par excellence, who, together with Cupid, stands on a pedestal in the middle ground. The servant, the only woman in the picture, might then personify the waywardness of the senses in the form of both illicit love and fine food, as opposed to the duty of the warrior. Finally, the strong presence of the sarcophagus dominating the scene appears to have a significance beyond that of pure classical-style decoration. So this picture is probably not as joyful as it appears, and may contain a lesson on vanity that still remains to be deciphered.

Among Egyptian board game accessories were throwsticks, which were used to determine how far players should move their pieces in the days before dice and knucklebones were imported from the Near East. Once the latter had arrived in Egypt throwsticks continued to be used, so the three types of object coexisted—but we do not know whether each was associated with a specific game.
Throwsticks, board game accessories
The first throwsticks, found in a funerary context, date from the Predynastic period. They can be associated with games and game pieces; a 1st-Dynasty Saqqara tomb yielded a whole set of accessories wrapped in woven reed: about forty marbles, six lions and lionesses, two series of seven game pieces, and eleven throwsticks. The 3rd-Dynasty tomb of Hesire featured these same items, depicted in two dimensions: four throwsticks were painted next to Senet pieces. Although they were not represented in later tombs—neither around the table, nor in players' hands—many examples continued to be unearthed. To judge from excavated objects and relief carvings, such sticks were certainly used to play Senet, and doubtless also to move the pieces for the games of Mehen and ""58 holes,"" as these games were played when neither dice nor knucklebones yet existed.
Form, material, and decoration
Originally, throwsticks were sections of palm wood or reed that were cut in two lengthwise, with a convex and a concave side, each of a different color and texture. Replicas of these long, natural sticks were made in bone, ivory, or wood, and often decorated or dyed on one side to make a clear distinction between the two faces. 
The decoration consisted of parallel lines that were incised in the middle and at both ends of the convex side of the stick, or of more fluid lines at the ends that created the shape of a finger with the outline of its nail. Texts concerning Senet mention a ""finger"" that accompanied the pieces—no doubt a reference to throwsticks. 
Tutankhamun's tomb yielded four ivory and ebony sticks that were decorated at the ends with nails, or with animal heads featuring slender muzzles and pointed ears like those of the fennec. Two of the sticks in the museum have this kind of tip—a decorative element for which we have no explanation. 
The use of throwsticks
We do not know exactly how Egyptian throwsticks were used, but it is tempting to look for clues in the identical sticks that are still used as dice in board games in the Arabo-Muslim world. They are used in sets of four, six, or eight, according to country. 
The sides of the sticks are differentiated by color: black and white, or white and green. Players throw them on the ground, and points are determined according to the number of black or white sides that land face up.
The Egyptian game of Tab requires four black and white sticks. The combination of 1 white + 3 black faces allows a player to place 1 piece on the board, or earns him 1 point (to advance one square); 2 whites + 2 blacks = 2 points; 3 whites + 1 black = 3 points; 4 whites = 4 points; 4 black = 6 points. 
It seems likely that throwsticks were similarly used in ancient times.

The simple chiseled form of the horseman sits atop two pieces of wood cut in the shape of a horse. Traces of red, white, and black paint are still visible; they were used to indicate the mane, the eyes, the saddle, and the harness. The toy is mounted on two wheels and could be pulled by a string, as do children today.
The object
The horseman and his wheeled horse or horses seem to have been carved quickly by a confident craftsman, who nevertheless had no concept of ""mass production."" The figure's anatomy is limited to a head with a sharply hewn face, a helmet-style head of hair, a broad chest, and two arms clasped tightly to his sides. The lower limbs are formed by nothing more than a rough stick shape that disappears between the two pieces of wood. It is attached to the horse by two dowels that run from one side of the horse to the other. The two thin pieces of wood were carved from tamarisk, which grows abundantly in Egypt. Though rough, the shape is clearly that of horses. Two upright ears, prominent eye sockets above short, square nostrils, a short tail that may once have had horsehair, and thicker hind legs immediately identify this animal as a horse. Two axles run through the bottom of the legs and are fitted with two sets of wheels; the front wheels are larger than the rear wheels, to compensate for the different lengths of the legs. Much like children today, the young owner must have pulled this toy around with a string tied to the front dowel. With just a few brushstrokes, the craftsman created a mane, two eyes, a saddle, and reins. Unfortunately, all that remains are traces of this polychromy in the red, white, and black on what must have once been a gleaming toy. None of the paint on the horseman exists.

The toy
This is not an unusual type of toy, and many wheeled animals were unearthed in the excavations of Byzantine necropolises, including hedgehogs, dogs, camels, cats, and lions. The originality of this work comes from the use of two horses instead of one. It is hard to know whether this is a depiction of an acrobatic horseman controlling two mounts, or if it is a whimsical portrayal by the toymaker.
The context
Many wooden toys, animals that could be pulled or played with, dolls to cuddle, and doll's tea seats were found in the tombs of children from the Roman-Coptic period. We know little about the world of toys from late Antiquity, as few texts exist. The few references to toys rarely provide descriptions, even brief ones, and the lack of images showing children at play from this late period means that we cannot accurately identify this type of work. For many years, and even still today, amulets, religious ex-votoes, and children's toys were lumped together, given the identical images and the small size of all these objects, adapted to children's hands. Nothing looks more like a statuette of a female deity than a doll, whether it is made of clay, wood, or stone.

396,Blue,Bowl,https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bowl-bearing-coat-arms-florence?selection=44855,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-bassin.jpg?1527826897,"
This bowl, with its powerful lines, is one of the most impressive relics of the earthenware trade in early 15th-century Florence. The iconography depicts a lion in a field of lily stems, bearing a banner decorated with the Florentine lily, symbol of the city. The bowl is obviously influenced by Spanish and Oriental earthenware, but it also heralds the new Italian majolica ware. This bowl should thus be seen in the context of the development of a new, original style.
The iconography of power
The majestic heraldic lion, or marzocco, dominates the inner surface of the bowl, facing left and holding in his front paw the banner of Florence with the city's lily emblem. The lion's head is skillfully highlighted against the background by the use of a patch of undecorated white glaze; the rest of the surface is covered with flowering lily stems and small patches of hachure and volutes. Around the flat edge of the bowl, a row of fleurons, every second one inverted, forms a saw tooth frieze. The rim is pierced by two holes, indicating that the bowl was meant to be hung on a wall and thus was purely decorative. At that time, Florence's republican institutions were in the hands of the Medici family (until 1494); the city was rising above its recent difficulties, and the bowl can be seen as a display of Florence's supremacy over other cities in the early days of the Renaissance, when new artistic avenues were being explored.
The origins of majolica ware
This bowl is one of the most interesting early pieces of majolica ware. The term majolica is generally used to describe Italian earthenware. It is thought to be a corruption of Majorca, as the ships carrying to Italy the sumptuously glazed earthenware produced in the workshops of Valencia stopped off in Majorca throughout the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, this new technique came into use in several parts of Italy, including Tuscany. In the 15th century, Tuscany became one of the leading centers of majolica production, first developing a style of ceramics with stanniferous enamel, and later a more individual local style. Nevertheless, the influence of Spain - where most earthenware was produced - is evident in the shape of this bowl, which is similar to that of the great flat-bottomed dishes, with an almost vertical inner border and a flat rim typical of Manises, in Valencia. This Spanish style was itself influenced by copper bowls made in Damascus.
Developing the use of color
This bowl, along with the jug on display beside it, is remarkable for its narrow palette of colors, dominated by verdigris. A large dish decorated with a man on horseback, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, belongs to the same ""famille verte"" style. This style is less well known than the typical Tuscan apothecary jars with two flat handles, decorated with oak leaves, animals, and human figures in thick cobalt blue glaze. The Louvre also has several examples of this style in Room 4. It was not until the second half of the 15th century that earthenware potters were able to control the firing process to the point where they could call on a wider palette of colors in their high-fired glazes.

This medal dates from the early twelfth century and represents an imaginary animal. It informs us about the technique of champlevé enameling on copper during the Romanesque period. There are nine similar medallions in other museums. They probably all originate from a chest made for the abbé Boniface of Conques (1107-after 1119) and are decorated with hybrid monsters recalling the bestiary, illuminations, and narratives of the period.
A collection of fantastical illustrations
This slightly rounded medallion has four small rings for attaching it. The decoration is perfectly etched within the frame and represents a winged dragon belching forth foliage; the dragon's tail also ends in foliage. It is surrounded by a Greek key-pattern frieze. Some of the motifs are characteristic of Romanesque art and are found as early as the eleventh century on frescoes such as that at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, for example. Animal themes, which can be observed on many tenth- and eleventh-century illuminations, are typical of western France, as are scenes of combat featuring a dragon. The winged dragon belching forth foliage is one of the most common motifs in Romanesque illuminations from western France.
The technique of champlevé enamel
The decoration, which combines white with two shades of green and three of blue, was executed in champlevé enamel on copper. This technique was developed in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries: grooves cut into the copper plaque are filled with enamel powder, and then it is fired. After firing, the enamel still adhering to the copper is polished.
A thriving artistic center in Aquitaine
This medallion is one of a group of ten divided between the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Bargello Museum in Florence. They most probably originate from one of the chests made for abbé Boniface of Conques. Abbé Boniface had two chests made, both decorated with enamel medallions. One of these is in the Louvre and displays the same type of animal decoration as the Carrand medallions. These medallions are likely to have been made within the artistic community active at the abbey of Conques and supported by the abbé Boniface. Works similar in style to the chest exist, such as the chest of abbé Boniface (still preserved) and the Bellac reliquary, testifying to the developments taking place in the art of enameling in Aquitaine during the Romanesque period, most notably in the Limousin and the Rouergue.

This chair was part of an astonishing collection of antiquities formed between 1819 and 1824 by Henry Salt (then British consul in Egypt), acquired by the Louvre in 1826 on the advice of Jean-François Champollion. Nothing, however, is known of where it was found. While it is of a type very common in the New Kingdom, its proportions and state of preservation are exceptional.
A remarkably well-preserved object
This chair has several remarkable features. In the first place, one might well wonder at the fresh appearance of an object supposedly 3,500 years old. Yet it is not a reproduction. The blue paint on the feet may have been restored, and the leather seat is modern, but all the rest is old. Its state can only be explained by its not having been handled since the time of its first use, around 1400–1300 BC. And this is indeed the case: it was deposited in the chamber of a tomb which survived inviolate, protected all that time from the depredations of humans, animals, and mold. The dry climate of the Egyptian desert is better suited than anywhere else on earth to the miraculous preservation of such artefacts in organic materials.
A sophisticated piece of furniture
This has the typical features of Egyptian chairs of pharaonic times: the relatively low seat and the lion’s-paw feet. The design of the back is of a type fashionable in the New Kingdom. Inclined and rolled backward at the top, it is strengthened by vertical supports. Like the supports, the back is provided with corner-plates whose elegant outline softens the angle between back and seat. Very elegant too is the curve in the center following the line of the back. The use of two woods in different shades, one light and one dark, enlivens the appearance of the wood surface, and has even been extended to the use dowel pegs of contrasting tone. The blue paint on the feet may have been restored in the 19th century, when the chair came to Europe. The color itself, however, was certainly in use in the New Kingdom: a tomb in the Valley of the Kings has a painting of a chair with similar blue feet.
Ancient Egypt and the Directoire style
The artists who accompanied Napoleon’s exhibition to Egypt and copied the paintings in the Valley of the Kings in 1799 could hardly have imagined that a real chair of this kind would appear in the Louvre. Acquired in Egypt by the British consul Henry Salt between 1819 and 1824, it was sold to the Louvre together with more than 4,000 other pieces. Contemporary enthusiasts in France for things Egyptian could not help but be impressed by this chair, so close to the Directoire style with its feet and curved roll back. For once, the vision of antiquity, part reconstruction and part dream, that had informed the taste of the late 18th century had found confirmation in ancient evidence.

This delightful statuette resembles a bright blue faience doll. Its elegant nudity and totally unrealistic color make it an attractive object, but the raison d'être of this anonymous character, fashioned without legs, remains something of a mystery.
Sign-laden female images
Naked female figurines of this kind were modeled in terracotta or siliceous faience - this is one of the best preserved. They have certain distinctive characteristics: although they have no legs, their naked bodies are tattooed like those of the dancers that were painted in the tombs, and they wear a belt of cowry shells (symbol of femininity) around their waists. Their hair was attached through the holes in their heads; a profusion of elaborate locks was considered especially erotic. No name is inscribed, which indicates that this statuette does not represent any particular person.
A world of faience figurines
This statuette is made of faience with a silica base - usually quartz or quartz sand - heated to 850  C. The surface was enameled with a copper blue glaze; the details in black were painted with manganese oxide. These were the only two colors that could be obtained in faience at the time; white was produced from high-purity quartz. Apart from the dolls made during this period, all kinds of animal figurines were created, including cats, mice, monkeys, puppies, hippopotami, and ducks, which were modeled from life rather than in the hieratic postures attributed to the animal forms of the gods. Such statuettes have been found in the ruins of dwellings, or in tombs and temples. No doubt they were part of the everyday environment, before perhaps being offered as gifts to the dead or the gods.
Unwritten popular practices
These figurines are commonly referred to as the dead person's ""concubines"" and may have accompanied the deceased to perpetuate his sex life. The erotic characteristics of which the ancient Egyptians were fond are accentuated here: large hips and thighs, necklaces, numerous and detachable locks of cloth hair, belts, and tattoos. Somewhat strangely for dancers, they appear to have been modeled without legs, to stop them from running away. Some of these figurines were found in female tombs, so it may be wiser to regard these naked ladies as images of femininity. We should not underestimate the Egyptians' profound belief in the ability of art to recreate reality by magical means. The function of such statuettes probably lays somewhere between the decorative and the religious; no doubt they correspond to popular practices of which we have no written trace.

These four, bright-blue glazed vases are in extremely good condition. They entered the Louvre collection as ""canopic"" recipients, designed to contain the embalmed viscera of the great king Ramesses II. Several recent studies have brought to light their long history from the temple to the necropolis.

	An enthusiastic purchase

	When these four beautiful vases were acquired in the early 20th century, art historians were convinced they were the canopic vases of Ramesses II. Indeed, they were filled with densely packed linens impregnated with organic material and they were inscribed with the names of the great king. Finally, there were four vases, as was the custom for these funerary recipients, designed to contain for eternity the embalmed organs removed from the body of the mummy. One of the vases contained a heart. Certain journalists protested strongly against this acquisition, saying it was too macabre. Yet an in-depth study of Ramesses' mummy conducted in Paris in 1976 revealed that the pharaoh's heart had remained in place, inside his mummified body.

	Exceptional vases

	Viewers were also charmed by the beauty of these ""faience"" vases, a quartz ceramic with a lovely blue glaze, decorated with formulas in black, praising King Ramesses. No other vase of equivalent size and in such good condition was known to exist. A recent study revealed that their small bucket shapes - or situlae - identifies them as liturgical vases used in temples to hold offerings to the gods. The texts dedicate the vases to the Theban gods Amun-Ra and Mut, rather than to Osiris or to the other gods of the dead. How, then, did they end up with this soiled linen and this heart?

	A thousand years and multiple uses

	Analyses now underway (J. Connand and colleagues, CNRS, to be published) reveal that the material on the inside is a trace of a scented unguent, not an embalming product; its dates from the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1035 BC). In addition, the resin contained in the heart dates from the early Ptolemaic Period (c. 275 BC). These liturgical vases, consecrated in a temple of Amun under the reign of Ramesses II, were therefore used as originally intended - as recipients for scented unguents, a traditional offering to the gods - until the Third Intermediate Period. They were co-opted at a much later date for the embalming rites of an individual.

This benevolent-looking hippopotamus slips into the marshes, taking on their colour and half-engulfed in water plants. Bright-blue Egyptian faience figures of hippopotami such as this were placed in the tombs of high-ranking civil servants toward the end of the Middle Kingdom.
A symbol
This bright-blue Egyptian faience hippopotamus, depicted ambling along, seems to slip into the water amids the water plants that form its decoration. Its excellent condition and large size make this an outstanding example of its kind: some fifty faience hippopotami, varying in size from 9 to 23 centimeters in length, are now scattered around the world. The calm, benign appearance of the hippopotamus has gained it such popularity that this blue figurine now conjures up the world of ancient Egypt and the Nile in our collective imagination.
A fresh appraisal
The story of this hippopotamus, which has been famous and popular for many years, has now been traced. In the late nineteenth century the egyptologists of the Cairo Museum, wanting duplicates of the finest works in their collection to be put on display in France, sold the hippopotamus to the Louvre. Yet this figurine has a unique feature: the four legs are connected by a strip of faience and rest on a plinth, making it the only one of its kind. Following archive research and a technical study the plinth was removed, as it did not belong to the original work and gave it the appearance of a modern ornament. We also know from its archeological context that it dates from the Seventeenth Dynasty, in the late Second Intermediate Period.
An object for the afterlife
The hippopotamus was buried in a tomb with funerary furniture comprising a coffin, statues of the deceased, a large number of vases, and a few toiletry items. It therefore served a function in the inner chamber of the tomb. The painted motifs varied from one hippopotamus to another, with water plants sometimes being combined with butterflies and birds, but the decoration of the hindquarters almost always consisted of a lotus flower in full bloom. Depicted half-submerged, the hippopotamus evokes the primordial waters of chaos, the Nun. According to an Egyptian creation myth, on the first morning after the birth of the world, the sun emerged from a lotus flower: ""Every being is born from the Nun."" The function of this hippopotamus statuette, placed near the mummy, was therefore to prefigure rebirth in the afterlife through the power of imitation.

This monumental lapis lazuli nef entered the collection of Louis XIV in about 1673. The nef itself is an Italian work dating from the 16th century. The mount was made in Paris in about 1670. The latter illustrates the transition between two styles of enameled goldwork: those of the ""white and green"" and the ""white and pink"" workshops. Spectacular in its workmanship, this nef has a long history and has been reproduced several times.
A nef in lapis lazuli
The nef is made up of four pieces of lapis lazuli. Lapis lazuli is an azure semiprecious stone. The considerable size of the nef itself required that an extra element be added: a large, triangular piece of lapis lazuli that was attached to the edge, on one of the sides. This nef is very thick: the edge is one centimeter thick in places. The outside of the vessel is decorated with gadroons in ""taille d'épargne"" (black enamel tracery); at the back, a large acanthus leaf is sculpted in bas-relief. The baluster foot is slightly flattened and may be a reused flask. It was attached to a molded oval knop. The oval base, slightly concave on the underside, is also decorated with cabled gadroons.
An enameled gold mount
Three holes indicate the existence of a mount dating from the same period as the stone. The present mount dates from the 1670s and is a combination of gilded silver and enameled gold. It illustrates the transition between the ""white and green"" and ""white and pink"" workshops. The ""white and green"" style of mount is reflected in the leaves decorated with black seeds and two satyr masks on the baluster, while the white and opaque pink enamel highlights are typical of the ""white and pink"" mounts. The appliqué enameled gold ornamentation is attached to the mount with folded-down tips. The decoration is made up of highly naturalistic garlands of fruits and flowers, possibly inspired by the goldsmith François Le Febvre's Book of Flowers, published in Paris in about 1635 with engravings by Balthazar Moncornet. At the back is the figure of Neptune, seated on a shell over a satyr's head, who would have held reins in his right hand to steer the boat drawn by the shark at the prow.
A long history
This monumental nef was designed by Jules Jacquemart for Henri Barbet de Jouy. The drawing is kept in the Louvre's Department of Prints and Drawings. The nef is also featured in the center of a painting by Charles Giraud, Interior of the Study of the Count of Nieuwerkerke, General Director of the Imperial Museums, in the Louvre (1859). Part of the mount was depicted in a still life by Blaise-Alexandre Desgoffe, now in the Musée d'Hyères. Finally, Charles Duron made a goldwork copy of the nef in 1868, which is now in a private collection. A blue porcelain and gilded bronze copy of the nef may also be found in Osborne House (Isle of Wight).

403,Blue,"Portrait of Madame Charles-Louis Trudaine, née Marie-Louise Micault de Courbeton (1769-1802), formerly known as Portrait of Madame Chalgrin, née Vernet",https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/madame-charles-louis-trudaine?selection=44855,https://www.louvre.frhttps://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/140x87/medias/medias_images/images/louvre-madame-charles-louis-trudaine.jpg?1527830909,"
This young woman, whose plain hairstyle and dress are typical of the Revolutionary period, was the wife of Charles-Louis Trudaine, who belonged to the liberal ""haute bourgeoisie"".  The canvas shows areas of vigorous scumbling, particularly in the red background.  The unfinished state of the canvas, which present-day viewers find attractive, is due to the quarrel between Trudaine and David over the Terror.
The discreet charm of a young woman
A refined young woman is sitting with her arms folded, her body in profile, and her face turned toward us.  She has a long nose and large, lively eyes.  She is wearing a dark dress with a blue belt, and a white fichu over the shoulders; together with the red background, these make up the colors of the Republican cockade.  Her loose, unpowdered hair is quite natural, and there is a simple, unaffected charm about her person.  The fact that the canvas is unfinished is attractive to contemporary eyes.
A liberal family
This is probably a portrait of Louise Micault de Courbeton (1769-1802), the wife of Charles-Louis Trudaine, a friend of the artist (and not of Madame Chalgrin, the daughter of the painter Joseph Vernet, as was long believed).  It is thought to have been commissioned in 1791 or 1792 by Charles-Louis Trudaine.  Before the revolution, David had painted The Death of Socrates (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), for the brother of Charles-Louis, Charles-Michel. The Trudaine family belonged to the liberal ""haute bourgeoisie"", which was initially favorable to the Revolution. The unfinished state of the portrait is probably linked to political events. The Trudaines quarrelled with David because of his support for the Terror. Furthermore, the two brothers went to the scaffold soon after this.  The painting demonstrates David's talent as a portraitist, though he was better known as a history painter and the author of The Oath of the Horatii (Louvre), a manifesto of neoclassicism.
Davidian scumbling
The framing creates a sense of intimacy between sitter and viewer. David displays great formal economy.  Space is suggested discreetly, and the slender silhouette stands out against a neutral background given immediacy by the vibrancy of the scumbling -- a characteristic of David's later portraits -- and by its redness. The unfinished work was painted without thickness. The scumbling is less apparent in the clothes than in the background, and the pigment is denser in the face.  The portrait differs from the majority of those David made before the Revolution, which were meticulously painted, and looks ahead to his portrait of Madame Récamier (Louvre).

Notable for its opaque gray-blue counter-enameling, this multicolored medallion was the work of the finest enameler in Limoges in the early years of enamel painting. Great skill is displayed in the treatment of the movements of the figures in this devotional scene, while the gold highlights and jewel-like effects of drops of translucent enamel contribute to the extreme refinement of the work.
Technique
The copper medallion was painted with layers of polychrome enamels; small strips of silver leaf were coated with translucent colors to decorate the clothes, the tiara of God the Father, the Virgin's crown and the borders of the garments. As was usually the case during this period, the opaque counter-enameling is in gray-blue.  
Subject and style
God the Father and the Virgin are seated on thrones placed on a green ground, a curious arrangement for a scene that takes place in the heavens, against a star-studded firmament. A Latin prayer is inscribed on the white border of the medallion, and the letters ""MA"" in gold adorn the Virgin's robe. The natural quality of the gestures, the finely rendered facial features and the abundance of translucent enamels on the tiny strips of silver leaf together make this medallion a quite exceptional example of its type.
Attribution
The style and the counter-enameling are characteristic of the work of the Master of the Triptych of Louis XII, a painting now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the side panels of which depict Louis XII and Anne de Bretagne. This painting can be dated with precision to between 1498 and 1514. Two other panels, depicting the aristocratic couple Anne de Beaujeu and Pierre de Bourbon, enable us to pinpoint the dating to the year 1504. In 1989, the Louvre purchased a large oval medallion depicting the Mater Dolorosa, attributed to the same enameler.

In the second century AD, this mosaic adorned a dining room in the house of a wealthy Roman in Antioch. Grape and ivy leaves filled with birds frame the legendary story of the judgment of Paris. Hermes asked the young prince to judge a beauty contest between Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, of which Aphrodite was the winner. Using a rich palette of colors and small tesserae, the artist sought to rival the Hellenistic Greek painting that he used as a model.
A dining-room floor
This mosaic was discovered in 1932 in Antioch in the Atrium House. Antioch, today known as Antakya and located in Turkey, was the former capital of the kingdom of Syria. The site has delivered up a remarkable collection of wealthy Roman villas decorated with mosaics. This panel was placed in the floor of a dining room, which was redone shortly after 115 AD, following a devastating earthquake that ravaged Antioch. The triclinium was a reception room in which guests dined while reclining on a U-shaped arrangement of couches. The organization of the decoration matched the arrangement of the room and the placement of the guests - several floor panels with figures decorated the threshold and center of the room, while the areas where the couches were placed featured plainer geometric patterns. The other panels, divided between other museums, depict a satyr, a Maenad, a drinking contest between Dionysus and Hercules, and Aphrodite next to Adonis.
The judgment of Paris
The Louvre's mosaic was placed in the center of the floor. The surrounding motif was inspired by a second century BC mosaic created for the palace of King Attalus at Pergamum, Asia Minor. Featuring two heads on each side, grape and vine leaves populated with birds and insects serve as a frame for the legendary story of the judgment of Paris, the son of Priam, king of Troy. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, asks the young prince, who was tending his flocks on the steep slopes of Mount Ida, for help in selecting which of three goddesses is the most beautiful. Athena, goddess of wisdom, equipped with aegis, helmet and spear; Hera, majestically seated in the center; or Aphrodite, who - sure of her success - sits casually on a rock. The scene takes place under the gaze of Eros and Psyche. Paris finally chooses Aphrodite for her dazzling beauty, and rewards her with the golden apple. 
A work in stone inspired by Hellenistic painting
Using a rich palette of colors and small tesserae, the artist sought to rival a Hellenistic Greek painting that he used as a model. Indeed, the composition of this panel was inspired by a Greek painting known from a copy preserved at Pompeii. The so-called opus vermiculatum technique, which used miniscule cubes of stone and glass paste, allowed mosaic artists to create pictorial effects such as color shading and plays of light and shadow. Mosiacists working in the Hellenized East, steeped in the traditions of Greek art, continued to compose veritable pictures in stone, in imitation of paintings. The judgment of Paris was a particularly popular theme in the repertory of antiquity, and yet it is rarely depicted in mosaics. We know of only two other examples, at Cherchel in Algeria and in Romania.

Mostly discovered before the technical means were available to conserve them, few ancient oriental mural paintings have survived. This little goat, which was part of a frieze, is one of the rare examples of the painted decoration of Assyrian palaces.
A premature discovery
During excavations carried out in 1929-31 at Tell Ahmar - formerly Til Barsip - on the left bank of the Euphrates some 20 kilometers south of the Turkish border, the archaeological expedition of the Louvre led by François Thureau-Dangin discovered an outstanding set of mural paintings from the Neo-Assyrian period. Unfortunately, at the time of the discovery, the archaeologists lacked the technical means to conserve the fragile paintings. Only a few fragments could be saved; they were detached from the wall and shared between the Aleppo Museum and the Louvre. However, a complete color survey was first made by the architect Lucien Cavro on rolls of paper now in the Louvre; they provide valuable documentation on the painted decoration of Assyrian palaces. 
Part of an Assyrian decoration
This palace was built some time after the conquest of the ancient Aramean city of Til Barsip by the Assyrian king Salmanasar III in 855 BC. The painted decor dating from the 8th century BC complemented or replaced the stone reliefs used in the big capitals. The decor is made up of large narrative compositions exalting the glory of the king and the power of the empire, as well as simple ornamental friezes. This fragment of painting, traditionally known as ""the blue goat"" - but more probably a wild male goat - was part of a frieze that decorated a corridor opening on to the audience hall. The frieze was made up of repeated groups of two ibexes in confrontation on either side of a decorative motif, in true oriental style. There is a striking contrast between the accurate observation of the animal and the symbolic nature of the blue color. 
A recently-identified pictorial technique
The three paintings exhibited in the Louvre were restored in 1986-87. Studies carried out at the time of restoration revealed the composition of the pigments. The blue is an ""Egyptian blue"" made from a double silicate of calcium and copper, intended to imitate lapis lazuli. The outlines are drawn in carbon black of animal or vegetable origin; the red is a natural ochre based on iron oxide. The colors were laid on the bare clay, lightly prepared with whitewash.

Each of these Nevers faience ewers is ornately painted, decorated with grotesque figures in relief, and adorned with a dragon-shaped handle. The bacchanalian scenes on the body are strongly Italianate, but were inspired by the work of French artists such as Dorigny and Chapron. The overall shape is that of a bronze vase made by goldsmith Claude Ballin the Elder for the gardens of Versailles. This pair of ewers evokes the magnificent goldwork pieces of the reign of Louis XIV, now sadly lost.
A shape inspired by the goldsmith's art
Ewers were customarily used at home for washing hands. This monumental pair of ewers is powerfully shaped, indicating that such objects could reach very large sizes. The richly painted decoration is matched by the exuberance of the motifs in relief-the handle in the shape of a dragon crushing a serpent's tail beneath its feet, grotesque figures on the body, and the leaves forming the lip. These motifs are inspired by the goldsmith's art, which enjoyed a golden age during the reign of Louis XIV. The ewers are directly inspired by the bronze vase made by Claude Ballin the Elder (1615-1678) for the gardens of Versailles sometime between 1666 and 1673, and engraved by Jean Lepautre (1618-1682). The exceptional size and magnificence of these ewers are not only a worthy homage to their model, but also proof of the technical mastery displayed by one of the great pottery centers.
The arrival of faience in France
Luigi Gonzaga (1539-1595) became Duke of Nevers in 1565 on his marriage to Henriette de Clèves, the heiress to the dukedom. He was well known as a patron of the arts and brought a group of Italian enamellers and potters to settle in Nevers. This was the first step in the creation of a major center of pottery manufacture, which was renowned until the 18th century. The potteries of Nevers played a key role in the unprecedented development of faience, or high-fired tin-glazed earthenware, in the country. The Italian style dominated the early production of Nevers pottery and remained influential into the following century. However, the town was something of a crossroads and gradually absorbed other influences. The influence of Far Eastern pottery, for example, led to the incorporation of mythical creatures into designs from the late 17th century. This tendency can be seen in the handles of the pair of ewers.
French-style istoriato ware
The high-fired, brightly colored decoration covers the whole surface of the ewers and hides the white earthenware. The waves at the base from which cherubs are shown emerging are copied from late-16th-century pottery from Urbino, Italy. The waves give way to four mythological scenes in large cartouches on the bellies of the ewers. These scenes are in the tradition of istoriato ware-pieces of Italian majolica illustrated with narrative scenes. However, some attempt has been made to adapt both the source and the style of the scenes to French taste. The bacchanalian episodes are drawn from French engravers including Michel Dorigny (OA 5013A) and Nicolas Chapron (OA 5013B). The Nevers painters have depicted the scenes with a freer hand, creating a synthesis that is less detailed and less academic in style.

These decorative panels of polychrome glazed brick come from the palace of Darius I at Susa. On a blue-green ground, a pair of winged lions with bearded human heads sit facing each other, their heads turned backward. Above them hovers the winged disc of Ahura-Mazda. This complex traditional iconography is rendered in a pure Persian style
Independent panels
The few surviving fragments of this panel were discovered in the north-east corner of the central court of Darius's palace. The panel consisted of moulded bricks glazed all over, including the sides. Unlike friezes of archers or lions, this scene represented a single element in a series of individual panels. It is clear that it was not set into the wall itself, but rather was applied to some projecting feature  (perhaps a pilaster of the same width), and placed in a prominent position, such as in a niche or above a door. The arrangement of the two scenes facing each other and their decorated edge indicate that these were ""free-standing"" panels.
A symmetrical composition, rich in colour
Two sphinxes, hybrid creatures with the body of a winged lion, sit facing each other, their human heads turned back in profile. A wing, curving upward at the tip, springs from the foreleg of each, and the head  rises from an ambiguous part of the body at a region that seems part human torso, part leonine breast The complexion of the face is dark. The eye is shown frontally. A long square-cut beard covers the lower part of the face. The hair emerges from beneath the headdress to be drawn back into a bulky mass at the neck, revealing a bull's ear wearing an ear-ring identical to those worn by archers. The cylindrical ceremonial headdress is endowed with three tiers of horns intended to demonstrate the divine nature of the sphinx.Above the two sphinxes is a disc with a yellow center surrounded by concentric rings of blue and white, flanked by two great outspread wings with a bird's tail beneath. From the meeting point of each wing and the tail there extends a ribbon, tightly curled at the end.
A traditional iconography
The winged disk was the symbol of Ahura-Mazda, ""greatest of the gods,"" a divine emblem ensuring royal and dynastic authority. This motif was borrowed from Egypt, from where it spread to the Levant and Assyria. It is often found in Syrian reliefs of the second millennium BC, where it is the symbol of the god Assur; Achaemenid artists, then, did not have to look far for their inspiration. The theme of paired animals, either facing each other or back to back, is three thousand years old. Having first appeared in the Uruk Period, it was more extensively employed in the first millennium, especially in gold work, ceramic vessels and ivories. The seal-cutters  of the Achaemenid period also made use of the motif. Human-headed animals made their appearance in Early Dynastic reliefs in the form of human-headed bulls, which appear again in two steatite statuettes of the Neo-Sumerian period. Much later, the imposing guardians of the doors of Assyrian palaces probably served as a model for those of the Gate of All Nations which marks the principal entrance into Persepolis. All wear the divine headdress, and their benevolent expressions confirm their role as beneficent spirits. The serene expressions of the sphinxes here seem to have been inspired by the royal model, conforming to the stereotype established in all the brick reliefs at Susa, and in the later stone reliefs at Persepolis. This face recalls the regular features of Darius as depicted on other monuments, which in turn are indistinguishable from those of his son Xerxes and their successors. The same royal canon, more idealized than realist, was applied to them all as evidence of the greatness of the empire. These sphinxes are thus both guardian deities and embodiments of the royal person.

The two retables decorated the altars against the rood-screen in the upper chapel, the Sainte Chapelle, in the Palais in Paris, from the 16th century. In February or March 1553, Léonard Limosin was commissioned to produce the two retables on the themes of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The medallions feature portraits of François I, his wife Claude de France, Henri II, and Catherine de' Medici. The angels bearing the instruments of the Passion were based on drawings by Nicolo dell'Abate.

	History of the retables

	The two retables were most likely installed in time for the Feast of the Assumption in 1553, as the document commissioning them, recently published, indicates. They were removed from the Sainte Chapelle during the Revolution. They ended up in the hands of Alexandre Lenoir who passed them on to the Musée des Monuments Français in rue des Petits-Augustins, Paris, where they were mounted on the pedestal as part of the reconstruction of the tomb of Diane de Poitiers, Henri II's mistress. The two retables were acquired by the Louvre in 1816, when they were put on show in the Apollo Gallery.

	The inspiration for the design

	In the library of the French national School for the Fine Arts are nine drawings attributed to Nicolo dell'Abate, an Italian artist who was called to Fontainebleau in 1552 to work on the chateau alongside another Italian artist, Francesco Primaticcio. The drawings still bear the tiny holes where the design was pricked through onto another medium, in this case enamelled copper. These drawings are a clue to the close links between Léonard Limosin and the Fontainebleau School. The commission for the retables notes that the Crucifixion and Resurrection, along with the royal portraits and the medallions illustrating the Passion, are to be based on drawings by Léonard Limosin. As well as the drawings of the eight angels, the medallion of the prayer in the Garden of Olives is also attributed to Nicolo dell'Abate.

	The technique

	Léonard Limosin used small strips of silver coated with translucent enamel for some items of clothing. The coloured enamels are placed on an underlying layer of white. On the strips around the Crucifixion scene are drawings in gold monochrome on a blue or black ground. This retable bears the insignia of François I, while the retable featuring the Resurrection is decorated with the insignia of his son Henri II.

This funerary necklace is composed of three rows of beads made of glass and gilded wood, and a serpentine scarab. It was found on the mummy of Sennefer, in the cemetery of Deir el-Medina. There are long spindle-shaped beads, smaller elongated ones, and many small round ones. The scarab still bears significant traces of gilding, and a text exhorting the heart of the deceased not to bear witness against him in the Court of the dead.
Sennefer's tomb at Deir el-Medina
The tomb of the craftsman Sennefer was discovered in February 1928 in the workers' cemetery at Deir el-Medina, during excavations conducted by Bernard Bruyère. This modest-sized tomb contained the coffins of Sennefer and of his wife Nefertiti, placed side by side. At their head was a small coffin in which a child had been buried. The floor was strewn with bouquets which had been placed there during the funeral, and round about were a number of canes, a chest, a chair, an amphora, and some crockery containing provisions.The tomb was only partly pillaged during Antiquity, and the mummies of Sennefer and his wife were found intact. Sennefer's coffin contained a wooden headrest, an ebony cubit rod, and a few copper items. His mummy wore a gilded cartonnage mask, and wreaths of vine and lotus leaves. The scarab was placed over the heart, held in place by the necklace.
On the proper use of heart scarabs
The raison d'être of the heart scarab can be found in Chapter 30 B of the Book of the Dead (the great funerary work in use during the New Kingdom). Various versions of this, the ""Formula for preventing the heart of a man from opposing him in the underworld"", are inscribed on heart scarabs. The chapter is as follows: ""Oh my heart of my mother, oh my heart of my mother, oh my heart of my existence, do not stand against me when testifying, do not oppose me in the Council, do not show hostility toward me before the Keeper of the Balance. You are my heart, that is in my body, the god Khnum who makes my limbs sound. When you go to the fine place made ready for us in the Afterlife, do not cause my name to stink before the members of the court who judge men, make it good for us and pleasant for the judge. Utter no lies against me.."" The heart scarab was thus intended to ensure that the heart (the seat of consciousness) kept quiet during the perilous ""Weighing of the Heart"", a ceremony which had to be undergone before the deceased was granted access to the Afterlife. The reciting of this formula on the scarab was thus a supplementary precaution to ensure a peaceful second life.
Glass - a precious material
Sennefer's grave goods suggest that, although he may not have been truly wealthy, he could at least afford the kind of quality materials that were not necessarily found in every tomb. The gilded wooden beads in this necklace, for example, were less costly than gold ones. However, the large drop-shaped glass beads prove that Sennefer had access to this luxury material, which was characteristic of the late 18th Dynasty.

Painted retable, perhaps commissioned by the Gaddi family, for one of the altars of the monastery of San Domenico in Fiesole (near Florence), where the artist later served as prior. The studied perspective and the physicality of the figures attest to the influence of Masaccio on the young Fra Angelico.
The Coronation of the Virgin
Based on apocryphal texts, the Coronation theme was widely disseminated in the 13th century through Jacobus De Voragine's Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend). The episode follows the Assumption and describes the celestial welcome of the Virgin by Christ, who lifts her above the multitude of the blessed. By way of nine marble steps of various colors, the Virgin climbs to Christ's throne, where a place to His right has been reserved for her. Kneeling with her head bowed, the Virgin receives the crown from the hands of her Son in glory. They are surrounded by the heavenly host, composed of angel musicians and saints, some of whose names appear engraved on their respective haloes; others are identifiable by their attributes. In the foreground, from left to right: St. Louis of France with his fleur-de-lys crown; Mary Magdalene, in red with her hair loose and holding a vase of perfume; St. Catherine of Alexandria with the wheel of her martyrdom; and St. Agnes, holding a lamb to her breast.
A Dominican commission
Several Dominicans, the patrons of this work, are recognizable by their white robes and black mantles. St. Dominic appears in profile; he holds a lily and above his head shines a red star. The martyred St. Peter is depicted with a bleeding wound on his head. The theologian St. Thomas Aquinas is also present, holding his writings and pointing to the scene. On the predella are scenes referring to episodes in the life of the order's founder: The Dream of Innocent III, Saints Peter and Paul Appearing to St. Dominic, St. Dominic Restoring Napoleone Orsini, Christ in the Tomb, The Dispute of St. Dominic and the Miracle of the Book, St. Dominic and his Companions Fed by Angels, and The Death of St. Dominic.
Fra Angelico and his times
The composition is based on the pyramidal structure of the steps and the figures of the Virgin and Christ. The space has been determined according to the laws of linear perspective; these define the angle of the paving stones, which converge at a point above the vase of Mary Magdalene. The space is coherent, each figure placed in such a way that all can be seen. The sculptural volume of the bodies, whose monumentality is accentuated by the low point of view, is reminiscent of the works of Masaccio, which Fra Angelico had the opportunity to contemplate in Florence. Unlike Masaccio, however, Fra Angelico rejected idealized architecture in favor of an aedicula with Gothic forms. The delicate modeling of the faces was inspired by that of Gentile da Fabriano and the color scheme by the palette of Lorenzo Monaco.

This set of three fauteuils and three chairs in a restrained cabriole style is part of the furniture ordered for Marie-Antoinette's ""cabinet intérieur""-her private apartment-at the Château de Saint-Cloud, which is now divided among the Musée du Louvre, the Château de Compiègne, the Château de Fontainebleau, and the Mobilier National. It was provided for the sovereigns' spring stay in 1788. Created by various craftsmen working together, these chairs represent a totally new design concept.
Saint-Cloud and royal orders in the time of Louis XVI
In 1785 Marie-Antoinette bought the Château de Saint-Cloud from the Duke of Orléans. The initial furnishings were simple and hastily commissioned or taken from other residences, until the Royal Furniture Repository ordered seating of appropriate quality for the king and queen's spring stay in 1788. This order was part of the ongoing policy of renovation of the royal residences implemented by Marc-Antoine Thierry de Ville d'Avray, the new intendant-general of the Royal Furniture Repository, and of Calonne, the new minister of finance, both of whom were appointed in 1783. They entrusted this task to the joiners Georges Jacob, Jean-Baptiste Boulard, and Jean-Baptiste-Claude Séné.
Furnishing the grand cabinet
The process involved a number of people. In October 1787 Jean Hauré, who coordinated the royal furnishings, received the order to furnish the grand cabinet. The order specified a settee, two bergères, and two fauteuils à la reine (all now at the Château de Compiègne), four semi-cabriole chairs à carreaux and four semi-cabriole fauteuils à carreaux (three of which are in the Louvre, the others in the care of the Mobilier National), two footstools (one now at Fontainebleau, the other lost), and a folding screen and a fire-screen (both also lost). The designs for the set had been provided by the Furniture Repository, and the wax models prepared by the sculptor-modeler Martin. The joinery was entrusted to Jean-Baptiste-Claude Séné. The settee was sculpted by Alexandre Régnier, the fire-screen by Matthieu Guérin, and the other pieces by Nicolas-François Valois.
Real inventiveness
The chairs and armchairs in the Louvre are described as ""cabrioles,"" their backs being lightly curved. The chairs are also ""à carreaux,"" meaning that the seat is lower than that of a ""chaise à garnir,"" to allow for a cushion (""carreau"") to be placed on it. This more comfortable type of chair may have been for ladies' use only. Stylistically, its design was something utterly new in 1787. The uprights of the back are fluted columns whose Ionic capitals are topped with pine cones. On the armchairs the bases of the baluster-style arm stumps rest on flower-decorated corner blocks. The upper part of the legs, with their beaded spiral fluting, is ringed by a floral wreath, and the apron is covered with a tracery frieze. These chairs are emblematic of the Louis XVI style in their antiquity-inflected architectural vocabulary and, still more, in their use of tracery and garlands of flowers. These features influenced Séné's subsequent work and would have a considerable impact on large-scale nineteenth-century furniture manufacturing.

This pillar fragment comes from a building constructed east of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. It represents the face of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten, in the easily-recognizable Amarna style. In the early years of his reign, the Pharaoh imposed the monotheistic cult of the god Re, whose visible manifestation on earth was the sun-disk, Aten. At the same time, he changed his name from Amenophis to Akhenaten.
From Thebes to the new city of Akhetaten
Amenophis IV, the son of Amenophis III and his favored queen, Tiy, came to the throne of Egypt in 1372 BC and reigned for seventeen years. After spending four years in Thebes, the city of his predecessors, he built a new capital, Akhetaten, in Middle Egypt. Amenophis IV made the new city the center of an official religion devoted to the god Re, who communicated his beneficent power to Earth via the rays of the sun-disk, Aten.In the early years of his reign, Amenophis IV ordered the construction of a sanctuary dedicated to the sun falcon, Re-Horakhty, east of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. The immense peristyle courtyard featured pillars decorated with colossal images of the Pharaoh, in the so-called ""Osirian"" pose: standing, legs together, with arms crossed on the chest and a royal scepter in each hand. The portrait is a fragment from one of these pillars.
A new artistic style
The figure corresponds closely to its architectural setting (this was a colussus carved on one side of a pillar), and respects the conventional pose and attributes of the Pharaoh. Its style and inscriptions, however, distinguish it from all other classical royal portraits. It is easily identified as a work in the Amarna style, corresponding to the reign of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten.Several documents record that the Pharaoh himself drew up new stylistic rules for his sculptors to follow. The new canon is represented perfectly here. The Pharaoh's body is no longer that of an athlete, expressing the power of his function; on the contrary, the shoulders are wide but flat; the chest is almost feminine; the waist high and narrow; the hips thick and wide, and the stomach low and round. The face is also typical of the new, more naturalistic tendency: the features are defined by straight, angular lines and flat surfaces, contrasting with softer, rounded forms. Its elongated shape is accentuated by a false beard that extends down to the chest.
The sun-god
The portrait's subject is identified by a number of cartouche inscriptions. The hieroglyphics do not mention the Pharaoh by name, but refer instead to the god he represented on Earth: ""Re-Horakhty appeared on the horizon as Shu, who is in the disk."" This colossus therefore represents the Pharaoh and his dynasty as the divinely-appointed incarnation of the sun-god.

The head of this statue of Augustus resembles the head of the statue (dated 20 BC) found in Livia's villa in Prima Porta, showing the emperor wearing a cuirass. In the eighteenth century the head was joined to a toga-clad body which is generally attributed to the Hadrianic period. The portrait is a prime example of Roman Augustan art: classical Greek idealism and Roman republican verism combine to extol the qualities of the emperor who restored peace and order to Rome.
A composite work
The Louvre has a number of portraits of Augustus, in various guises and at various ages. He is depicted here at about forty years old. It is generally admitted that the toga-clad body was carved at a later date than the portrait itself. The treatment of the loose, flowing folds of the toga recalls Hellenistic art, leading some to interpret it as a work from the Hadrianic period. It is thought that the head and body were assembled during the eighteenth century when the portrait belonged to the Giustiniani collection in Venice; by the time it reached the Vatican collections in 1780, it was in its present form. After the Treaty of Tolentino in 1797, the statue came to France together with other works from the papal collections; following Napoleon's defeat in 1815 it did not return to Italy, but was exchanged for Canova's colossal statue of Napoleon, and remained in Paris.
The emperor Augustus (27 BC to AD 14)
The emperor's features are familiar from the many other portraits of Augustus: a finely-drawn profile with a hooked nose and pronounced chin, a high forehead above low, well-defined eyebrows, clear, bright eyes and prominent cheekbones. The forked locks of hair on the forehead are another distinctive feature.The typology of this portrait has been compared to a statue of the emperor wearing a cuirass, found in his wife Livia's villa in Prima Porta and dated to circa 20 BC. Augustus, fresh from negotiating peace with the Parthian kingdom, is shown as the serene, magnificent architect of the Pax Romana, a period of relative tranquility throughout the Roman world, that lasted until the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius in AD 180.
Augustan classicism as a political tool
This statue illustrates the classicizing taste that characterized most imperial portraits from the Julio-Claudian Period.The inclusion of certain recognizable, individual traits echoes Roman republican traditions of verism, but the physiognomy is nonetheless highly idealized. The moderation and authority of the ruler of Rome are glorified using techniques and styles borrowed from classical Greek sculpture: the avoidance of dark shadows on the face, the resolute but unstrained expression. The subject is imbued with an almost superhuman nobility. Imperial portraitists did not attempt to create a perfect physical likeness, but to serve the emperor's ideology and extol his qualities.

This piece of sculpture illustrates the level of skill achieved by certain artists during the el-Amarna period. The sculptor fully mastered the style and strictly applied the canons imposed by the new doctrine. The secret of this work's success lies in the delicate volumes: the shape of the body's lower limbs is underscored by the drapery of the clothing, which is slightly incised in the red sandstone. This expansive female body is generally identified as Nefertiti, wife of Amenophis IV- Akhenat
Sensuality
The sculptural quality of this anonymous fragment is surprising, as is the presence and sensuality of the female figure, even though it severely damaged. The woman is depicted standing, with her left leg forward; one arm hangs alongside her body, while the other was probably stretched out in front (perhaps she was playing a musical instrument or presenting an object?). The work, which has a back column, may have been placed on a base. The presentation is traditional, yet the style is unique, in keeping with the rules imposed by Amenophis IV-Akhenaten for artists working at his court.The contrast between the upper section of the body, the pelvic area and the thighs is softened by the addition of two pieces of fine linen clothing; the folds, ties, and transparency accentuate the figure's curves and volumes.
The pose and modeling
This work is also exceptional for the balance between the pose and the sculptural modeling. The hieratic aspect of the pose provides stability, which is reinforced by the vertical lines of the back column, the vertical drop of the arm, and the figure's strict frontal presentation. The sculpture's natural humanity and sensitivity comes from the supple forms of an extremely feminine figure.
Queen Nefertiti
This statue has no inscriptions of any kind, yet it could be situated and identified from specific features. During the reign of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten, for example the use of quartzite was reserved exclusively to the royal family. Thin, transparent linen was the fabric of choice worn by divine and royal figures from the earliest dynastic periods. Furthermore, the features of the king and his wife, Nefertiti, are known from other works discovered in the primary edifices of this reign.Nefertiti would therefore have been associated with the cult of the solar god via this now incomplete image and would have been an object of worship as part of the royal couple.

This bust with its determined expression is a portrait of Emperor Caracalla (AD 211-217). It is an expression of both the prince's psychology and his politics, and testifies to the importance of the military side of political life in the early third century AD. The vigorous modeling, worlds away from the baroque effects of the Antonine period, is a prelude to the more simplified portraits created in the second generation of the Several dynasty. 
Caracalla (AD 211-217)
The emperor Caracalla is here depicted in a bust, wearing a breastplate over which is draped the ""paludamentum,"" a distinctive sign of a military leader. The head is slightly turned to the right. The hair is arranged in short, tight curls on the emperor's large round skull. The determined look finds expression in the contracted muscles of the forehead, creating two horizontal lines, and the tight mouth marked by lines in the corners. The gaze from beneath the shadow of his prominent brow adds to his intense concentration, as does the firmly drawn mouth and the tight jaw. 
A soldier-emperor
Like his father Septimus Severus, who reigned from AD 193-210, Caracalla was a military emperor. At a time when the borders of the Roman Empire were threatened and a renewed policy of conquest was underway, the army once again played an central role in the exercise of power - it was essential for an emperor to have its support. By adopting a military-style beard and short hair, as well as wearing the breastplate draped with the ""paludamentum,"" Caracalla allies himself with his soldiers. In addition, an image of the emperor as a soldier with a rough, almost malevolent, expression represented a break with the image of the noble, just prince that was traditionally conveyed by such official art, particularly in the portraits of Marcus Aurelius. Caracalla took great pains to give himself a fearsome appearance, staring down all challengers. 
A new approach to portraiture
This type of portrait is known from other images, the so-called ""Tivoli"" portraits, named after the place where one of them was found. In these, the princely features are easily recognizable, but they lack the exaggerated contraction of the forehead and contorted neck that characterize the so-called ""Farnese-type"" portraits from AD 212-215 - a time when Caracalla had his brother and co-regent Geta assassinated and began to rule the Empire alone. The image we have of Caracalla is that of a brutal dictator, so this gentler representation has led some to think that this is a portrait from early in his reign. This hypothesis is still under discussion, however: some see the ""Tivoli""-type portrait as a creation from the end of Caracalla's reign - a reaction against the exaggerated expressionism of the ""Farnese"" style. In any case, the sober execution of this piece represents a step forward in Roman portrait art. The naturalist technique and the reduced volume of the hair - no longer an excuse for the sculptor to display his or her skill with the trepan - speak of a refusal of surface effects and the decorative excess that had been fashionable since the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The frankness and simplification of this work prefigure the trend toward schematization that so influenced Roman portrait art starting in the third century AD.

One of the masterpieces of the artist's English period, dating from about 1635. It was paid for by the king in 1638, and was meant to be a portrait of the monarch ""at the hunt,"" hence his aristocratic - and therefore elegant and distinguished - rather than specifically royal appearance (there are no monarchic insignia, merely an inscription). An unforgettable lesson in pictorial harmony between human figures (the king and equerries), animals (the horse), and landscape background.  
A gentleman out hunting
As the painter noted in a memorandum written in French in about 1638, he portrayed the king ""at the hunt."" Van Dyck, a former assistant of Rubens whose equestrian portraits were profoundly influenced by Titian, invented a highly innovative royal iconography here. The painting is not, strictly speaking, an official royal portrait. Charles I has no doubt just dismounted for a short rest while two pages are care for his horse. The king is portrayed here as a gracious gentleman, an elegant courtier like the one Baldassare Castiglione described in his famous treatise.
Regal self-assurance
But this elegant portrait, despite its apparent casualness, is nevertheless a statement of royal grandeur. As the Latin inscription, Carolus.I.REX Magnae Britanniae, proclaims, Charles I reigns supreme over Great Britain, hence over the united kingdoms of England and Scotland.The king's costume is, of course, far too luxurious for a day's hunting: wide-brimmed hat, elaborate turned-down boots, and above all the magnificent doublet on whose silvery fabric the painter displays his mastery of shimmering light effects. He artfully enhances the figure of the king by placing him to one side, well-lit and standing out against a bright sky, while his servants are in the shade on the right. The king is looking out over a coastal landscape illustrating his kingdom's diverse riches. His overall pose is a subtle compromise between gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance: one hand proudly on his hip, the other resting on his walking stick, as noble an attribute as the sword at his side. The low-angle viewpoint accentuates the king's haughty expression.
The founder of the English school
The portrait is thought to have been painted around 1635, ten years before the king's tragic death. Van Dyck had left Antwerp for London, where he had become official portrait painter to the English court. His many brilliant portraits of the British aristocracy laid the foundations of the English school. His style, oscillating between aristocratic reserve and sumptuous elegance, influenced Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. It is not known exactly how this picture found its way to France in the 17th century, but we do know that Countess Du Barry acquired it for her chateau at Louveciennes and later sold it to Louis XVI, who would suffer the same fate as Charles I.

After the death of Julius Caesar, the triumvirs who ruled Rome, Mark Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus, eliminated the republicans and shared out the Roman Empire (Octavius, the West; Mark Antony, the East; and Lepidus, Africa). Mark Antony, seduced by Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, gradually gave up his possessions to her. Octavian declared war on Egypt and triumphed over Mark Antony at the battle of Actium, after which Cleopatra committed suicide by means of an asp. 
A theatrical and sensual work
The artist has transformed a tragic historical episode into a sensual and voluptuous image. The queen is languishing, half-lying on her bed, supported by a cushion and her left arm. Barois perhaps had in mind a classical statue much admired since the Renaissance, Ariadne Abandoned, considered at the time to be a respresentation of Cleopatra. A cast of the original, in the Vatican, was made for Francis I by Primaticcio (a Florentine artist working at the French court), and a bronze copy was made for the Château de Fontainebleau. Cleopatra's garment, with braids and with a metalwork belt, has slipped to reveal her breasts. The limp left shoulder, the head hanging back, and the eyes gazing heavenward express a somewhat ecstatic pain. Part of her veil clings to her bare shoulder. The sculptor, who is using the subject as a stylistic exercise in drapery, accentuates the scene's voluptuousness.
The statuette replaces the bas-relief
François Barois was admitted to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture on the strength of this sculpture on October 30, 1700. His was the first of the series of in-the-round admission pieces that the Académie would subsequently prefer to bas-reliefs. The marble statuette of Polyphemus submitted by Cornelius Van Cleve as his admission piece in 1661 was an exceptional precedent. This type of statuette became the norm until the Académie was abolished in 1793.

This statue represents a king, sitting on a throne covered in inscriptions in the name of Ramesses II. The original identity of this work was the subject of much heated debate: traces of modifications to the crown, face, torso, and throne were long thought to indicate that the king had re-used an older work. It is almost certain, however, that these changes resulted from the monument being moved to another site during the course of the great pharaoh's sixty-seven-year reign.
A statue surrounded by doubts
This statue represents a figure in traditional pharaonic pose: seated on a cubic throne, his hands flat on his thighs, wearing the nemes headdress with a (broken) cobra, and a false beard. The names and titles of Ramesses II are inscribed on the belt buckle, and on the back and sides of the throne. The surface of the stone shows traces of modifications to the crown, face, neck, and part of the torso and throne. Some specialists therefore accused Ramesses II of having re-used the work of one of his predecessors, namely Amenophis III.
A hieroglyph-statue
Ramesses has not been proven guilty however: the round (somewhat smug) face of this king corresponds exactly to the iconography of Ramesses II. To achieve this result, the face of Amenophis III would have had to be totally resculpted - such a complex and delicate plastic surgery operation would have entailed the risk of scrapping a block weighing several tons. Moreover, the inscriptions are obviously intact, with no signs of scalpel work or traces of a previous name. According to Egyptian belief, an image only acquired an identity once it was given a name; its physical resemblance to the original was of secondary importance. A king's image was his hieroglyph rather than his portrait. When Ramesses II re-used an existing statue (which he often did), he had only to replace the victim's name with his own.
Ramesses II, revised and updated by himself
Consequently, there must be a different explanation for the modifications to this sculpture. Ramesses II probably had this effigy carved a few years after his accession, according to an aesthetic very similar to that of Amenophis III, whose reign was considered a political model. Each side of the throne was decorated with the motif representing ""the union of two lands""; we know for sure that this featured on the original work. The statue was modernized at a later date during the course of Ramesses II's sixty-seven-year reign, no doubt for one of the festivals (""jubilees"") held to confirm royal power: the statue's crown and beard were decorated with gilding, the sides of the throne inscribed with the royal names (facing the goddess of the South on the right side and the goddess of the North on the left); the back was covered with similar inscriptions.At the time of this beautification, it seems that the colossus was transported from its initial site to Pi-Ramesses - the great capital, which we know from texts to have been the center of jubilee celebrations. Perhaps the modifications to the face and torso were due to an accident that occurred on this occasion, or during the subsequent (and certain) transfer of the statue during the 21st Dynasty, from Pi-Ramesses to Tanis, where it was discovered together with hundreds of other monuments of the same pharaoh, also taken there from Pi-Ramesses.

The coronation sword of the Kings of France entered the collections of the Louvre following the French Revolution, together with the other ceremonial items previously held in the treasury of the abbey of Saint-Denis. With some of the ornaments on the pommel dating as far back as the tenth and eleventh centuries, this sword is one of the oldest surviving examples of French regalia.
Regalia
Kept in the royal abbey of Saint-Denis, items of regalia were used during the coronation ceremonies of the Kings of France, which took place at Reims. In the first part of the celebration, the king received the insignia of knighthood, consisting of spurs and the sword. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, the sword was entrusted to the ""Connétable"", who held it with the blade pointing upwards. The treasury of Saint-Denis possessed several medieval swords, but of these only the one in the Louvre seems to be the celebrated ""Joyeuse"".
""La Joyeuse""
The sword of Charlemagne is the only one known to have served as the coronation sword of the Kings of France. Dubbed ""La Joyeuse"", it was already celebrated in early medieval chansons de geste. It is possible that it was first used for the coronation of Philippe Auguste in 1179, but it is first mentioned at the coronation of Philippe III the Bold in 1271.
Different techniques, different periods
The sword is composed of a great variety of elements. Both sides of the pommel are decorated with a repoussé motif representing birds affrontee, similar to Scandinavian ornaments of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The two cross-guards, in the form of stylized winged dragon figures, can be dated to the twelfth century. The gold spindle, covered with a diamond net pattern, seems to be from the thirteenth or fourteenth century. The scabbard, a long velvet sheath embroidered with fleur-de-lis, was added much later, for the coronation of Charles X in 1825. The oldest elements of this scabbard are, on the one hand, the large metal plate adorned with gemstones mounted on filigree bezels, characteristic of the second half of the thirteenth century, and, on the other hand, the buckle and buckle plate. Despite these extensive additions and alterations, the sword remains a valuable example of the magnificent regalia used for the coronation of the Kings of France.

It was the custom of the kings of France to have their own personal crown made for their coronation. Louis XV commissioned two crowns: one in enameled gold and the other, now in the Louvre, in silver-gilt embellished with precious stones. In 1729, however, this crown was dismantled and the original jewels replaced with paste imitations. The crown was worn only at the coronation, after which it was placed in the abbey of Saint-Denis with the rest of the royal regalia. 

	A work composed of pearls and precious stones

The crown of Louis XV consists of an embroidered satin cap encircled by a metal band; springing from this are openwork arches surmounted by a fleur-de-lis. The band was originally bordered with two rows of pearls and set with eight colored stones (sapphires, rubies, topazes and emeralds) alternating with diamonds. At the base of the arches were five-diamond clusters forming fleurs-de-lis. The famous Regent diamond, purchased a few years before the coronation, adorned the flower at the front. The eight quadrangular diamonds that surmounted the flowers were from the set of eighteen Mazarin diamonds. The crown is topped by a fleur-de-lis formed from silver acanthus leaves, set originally with the Sancy diamond and seventeen others. A further twenty-four diamonds were sewn onto the cap. In 1729, the pearls and precious stones were replaced by paste imitations at the command of Louis XV. In all, the crown contained 282 diamonds (161 large and 121 small), 64 colored stones (including 16 rubies, 16 sapphires and 16 emeralds) and 237 pearls.

	The craftsmanship of Parisian jewelers

	Louis XV's personal crown was designed by the jeweler Claude Rondé and executed under the supervision of the young Augustin Duflos, jeweler to the king at the Galeries du Louvre. Shortly afterwards, in 1723, again working for Rondé, Duflos made a crown almost identical in design and size for King Joseph V of Portugal. In 1725, Rondé delivered another crown to the queen, similar in composition but smaller in size.

	Descriptions of the crown of Louis XV

	Two contemporary descriptions of this work have survived: the first was published in ""Le Mercure"" a month after the coronation, in November 1722, and the second appeared as a caption to an engraving by Sébastien Antoine. The latter specified that the crown was adorned with sixty-four colored stones, but mentioned only 273 diamonds and diverged in several other respects from its present appearance. It is therefore possible that its current form is not entirely faithful to the original composition, and that any differences may be the result of the restoration undertaken by the jeweler Maillard in 1780. Despite these slight modifications and being set with imitation stones, Louis XV's personal crown indicates both the sumptuous nature of royal ceremonial and the virtuoso skills of eighteenth-century jewelers.

Of the many effigies of the emperor Hadrian that have come down to us, this one stands out because of its material, which makes it one of the most remarkable of the Louvre. The imperial portrait type has not been clearly established, rendering difficult the task of dating the work. The dignified, albeit austere features may point to it being a posthumous portrait made to resemble the prince's successor, Antonius Pius. Alternatively, it may represent the monarch in the early years of his reign.
The emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138)
The wavy hair and voluminous curls on the forehead enable us immediately to identify the figure portrayed: Hadrian was the only emperor to adopt this hair style. This head is all that is left of a colossal statue some 2.6 meters in height. The body would have been idealized, with the emperor shown as a breastplated war chief (a standard type of representation) and not, as has been suggested, as a heroic nude, since the cut of the head eliminates this hypothesis. 
Numerous, innovative pictorial representations
The portrait was an important means of political expression in Roman times: statues of the emperor erected in all public places (theater, forum) were for the population of the empire the everyday mark of Roman authority and presence.Hadrian paid particular attention to his image, as the five hundred or so portraits that have come down to us indicate: with the exception of Augustus, no other emperor has left us as many images of himself.Moreover, the portraits of Hadrian are of particular interest where the history of Roman portraiture is concerned. From Hadrian's reign onward, sculptors began to show the iris and pupil of the eyes in their marble portraits, no longer by painting them, but by sculpting them. Hadrian, the philhellene, also introduced the custom of wearing a beard, like the Greek philosophers; this fashion was not that of his predecessors but was adopted by almost all the Roman emperors up to the fourth century. 
Posthumous portrait or portrait in the early years of Hadrian's reign?
This head is exceptional in both the material used (many Greco-Roman bronzes were melted down and lost forever) and in the type of representation. Portraits of the emperor are generally classified by type, but this effigy does not correspond to any of those defined for Hadrian.The face, longer than usual, the eyes, wider than was customary, and the hooked, crooked nose were rare, if not novel features among the surviving images of the prince. This was long thought to indicate that it was a posthumous portrait. An idealization of the features of the deified sovereign was combined with an intentional physical resemblance to Hadrian's successor, Antonius Pius (AD 138-161), to underscore the continuity of power. A more recent study questions this theory and prefers to see this Louvre head as a variant of the type developed in the first years of Hadrian's reign, in the period AD 118-121. This new hypothesis illustrates the difficulty of establishing an exhaustive and reliable classificaton of Roman imperial portraits.

This bronze statuette, which has been said to be of Charlemagne, was discovered by Alexandre Lenoir in the treasury at Metz Cathedral in 1807 and is inspired by equestrian statues from antiquity, such as that of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The representation of Charlemagne or Charles the Bald as a horse-riding figure highlights the Carolingian emperors' interest in the thematic repertoire of antique art. The monarch, holding a globe and a sword (now missing), asserts his authority as a conqueror.
From Metz Cathedral to the Louvre
From the sixteenth century on, inventories of the treasury at Metz Cathedral list the presence of two statuettes of Charlemagne: one of gilded silver, made by the Metz silversmith François in 1507; the other of 'bronze' or 'gilded copper' and listed in 1567. The Louvre statuette would seem to correspond to the second of the two. Both statues appear again in the 1657 and 1682 inventories. The one in bronze, rediscovered in Metz in 1807 by Alexandre Lenoir (1793-1816), the founder and subsequently Director of the Musée des Monuments Français, remained in Lenoir's personal collection until the middle of the nineteenth century. It was sold by his heirs to M. Evans-Lombe and then acquired by the city of Paris for the sum of 5000 francs. After being damaged in a fire, the statuette was entrusted to the Musée Carnavalet and, in 1934, was exchanged for an object in the Louvre. Artists working in bronze in the Carolingian period took up the Gallo-Roman tradition of casting and based their works on examples from antiquity, such as the Regisole in Pavia or the gilded bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The latter, which was erected at some point before the sixteenth century in front of the basilica of Saint John Lateran, was thought in the Middle Ages to be a depiction of Constantine crushing paganism. The Louvre statuette might therefore be a portrait of a Carolingian ruler as the 'new Constantine'.
An Equestrian Bronze in Three Parts
The statuette was inspired by the equestrian bronzes of antiquity and is a rare extant example of the Carolingian bronze-casters' art. The whole consists of three parts - the horse, the rider's body and saddle, and the rider's head - cast separately in metals of different composition. The horse bears all the characteristics of antique or Late Empire horse statues and is thought to have been re-used, a hypothesis that would help explain why the horse was altered to match the rider, and why the saddle covers part of the reins and harness.
The Rider: Charlemagne? Charles the Bald?
The rider is certainly Carolingian, but the identity of the ruler remains a matter of dispute. The face does indeed correspond to depictions of Charlemagne on coins, as well as to the description of Charlemagne made by his biographer Eginhard. However, the rider could equally be Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, whose features, as known to us from manuscript illuminations, are deliberately reminiscent of those of his grandfather.

This gilded and enameled copper parade helmet was found during the excavation of the Cour Carrée in 1984. It was identified as that of King Charles VI because of its fleur-de-lis decoration, and by comparison with the 1411 inventory of the king's armory.
A surprise find at the bottom of a well
The helmet was found in the well of the tower of Philippe Auguste, which was filled in in 1528. It was in over one hundred and fifty pieces on discovery, which explains its fragmentary condition after reconstruction. It consists of two parts: the helmet itself, and a crown that was fixed to the lower rim above the visor. 
Thanks to the precious materials and elaborate technique with which it was made (chased, enameled, and gilded copper), it was immediately identified as a parade helmet rather than protective headgear for war or tournaments. 
The fleur-de-lis decoration, fleurons on the crown, and fleur-de-lis motif in the rectangular enameled medallions indicate that it was a royal helmet. The 1411 inventory refers to a ""...hat of gilded iron with fleur-de-lis raised to a crown, winged stags below, and a motto saying EN BIEN with a fleur-de-lis above."" Traces of the inscription (""En ien"") are still visible, as are the fixation holes for the two winged stags that were once attached to the upper part of the helmet where they sprang from a network of hazel or wild rose on a guilloche background (common on royal items). 
A helmet attributed to Charles VI
The discovery site of the helmet supports its attribution to King Charles VI, as does the description of the king's emblems and mottoes. The use of ""badges"" composed of a ""motto"" (""en bien"") and a symbol (a winged stag) emerged in the West from the mid-14th century onward, together with the tradition of hereditary coats of arms (the royal emblem of the fleur-de-lis, in this instance). 
The emblem or badge of Charles VI—the white winged stag—featured not only on the helmet but also on one of the two enameled bronze pennons, the second bearing a decoration of pheasant feathers. Other items were also found in the well: a fragment of a sword sheath featuring a silver plated hind, a leather strap with an engraved image of the same animal, a gilded bronze rivet decorated with a double broom pod, and a small bronze disc featuring the Hebrew letter ""shîn"".
This helmet—the only known example of its kind, and the sole surviving trace of the Louvre as it was at the time of Charles VI—testifies to the misfortunes and upheavals of that period.

Gudea, prince of the independent kingdom of Lagash in the late 3rd millennium, is known for his piety and prolific building of temples. This statuette is the only complete specimen of a series of diorite representations of this prince, alternately standing and sitting. An inscription engraved on his robe indicates that it is dedicated to the god Ningishzida.
A complete statue of Gudea
This statue was found during the excavations at Tello (ancient Girsu), capital of the kingdom of Lagash. It was unearthed in two stages: E. de Sarzec found the head in 1877; Captain Cros, his successor, discovered the body in 1903. The French archaeologists had already found many of these diorite figures with massive bodies, sometimes shown standing, sometimes seated. None of them were complete, however: the bodies were found without heads, the heads were isolated. L. Heuzey succeeded in assembling the two fragments of this statue, the first and only complete representation of this prince, with an engraved inscription on the robe enabling us to identify him as Gudea, patesi of Lagash in the mid 22nd century BC.
Gudea, prince of Lagash
The reign of Gudea, illustrated by this series of representations, is relatively well documented. Following the fall of the Akkadian empire, the cities of southern Mesopotamia founded independent dynasties: Gudea succeeded his father-in-law Ur-Ba'u, founder of the second dynasty of Lagash. He devoted himself to building temples to the most important gods of Girsu: Ningirsu and Nanshe, Ningishzida and Geshtinanna. The statuary of his reign, consisting mainly in representations of himself, is a reflection of his piety, in constrast with the bellicose themes of art of the Akkadian period. The inscription on the statuette is a dedication to the god Ningishzida, who was Gudea's personal god; a list of the temples built by the prince follows, ending with the temple of Ningishzida built in the oldest district of the city, where the statuette stood.
A royal portrait
Wearing a royal turban with stylized curls on his head, the clean-shaven face of Gudea is calm and smiling. His almond-shaped eyes are surmounted by large eyebrows represented in the conventional fish-bone shape. He wears a draped, fringed robe, a garment already worn in the Akkadian period. One muscular arm is left uncovered. His hands are joined in a sign of piety. The tranquil, powerful pose of the prince is underscored by the dark color of the diorite, used in all of his representations. This stone already had a kingly connotation in earlier periods, and it is known through a text that Gudea, anxious to ensure the durability of the work, imposed its use, importing it at great cost from the Gulf region. The unusual proportions of the figure are also striking: in the absence of a neck, the head appears too large, encased in a body that is too small. The undeniable quality of the workmanship rules out any clumsiness on the part of the sculptor, so the figure's odd form either reflects a sculptural convention of the period or technical constraints related to the use of a block of stone in its natural state.

This drawing, with portraits of Henry II and his wife Catherine de Medicis in the center, belongs to a series of allegorical and historical compositions on the rule of the Valois from Francis I to Charles IX. The series, titled Histoire françoyse de notre temps, dates from the reign of Charles IX. It illustrates a text written by Nicolas Houel, a Paris apothecary seeking favor with the royal family.
A posthumous portrait
The drawing uses a framed tripartite structure inspired by the decorative principles that Rosso applied in the François I gallery at Fontainebleau. The double royal portrait in the center-the faces have been laid on top of an initial sketch that can still be seen against the light-combines the usual insignia of majesty and fabulous mythological figures. Henry II is shown in armor, in accordance with the knightly ideal. He is wearing the collar of the royal order of St. Michael and, like his wife, the mantle decorated with fleurs de lis and ermine of the French sovereigns. To show that their authority derives from an order superior to that of common mortals, the portraits are dominated by a representation of Olympia in which Jupiter is sending Mercury to the king, bearing the insignia of power: crowns and the sceptre. Several details show that Henry II was dead when the portraits were made (the obelisk behind him can be read as a funerary monument) and that he has handed his power over to the queen (in the shape of a horn of plenty). The shadow beside the king, and day dawning beside the queen, also symbolize his passing.
To the glory of the king
The rest of the decor is similarly eloquent. At the top, on either side of the arms of the king and queen, and at the bottom, flanking a cartouche, women with horns overflowing with fruit are allegories of Plenty. On the left, Apollo, the god of music and poetry, and Minerva, the goddess of war and industry, flank a medallion showing a temple where a goat is being led to sacrifice. On the right another medal, which depicts a harvest scene, is flanked by Juno, the sovereign goddess and protectress of married women (so it is not surprising to see her beside Catherine de Medicis) and Ceres, the maternal goddess of the earth and vegetation. All this is meant to suggest ideal prosperity, which failed to materialize during the reign of Henry II and was even more conspicuously absent during Catherine de Medicis' regency for her son Charles IX.
Aspiring to the absolute
The son of Francis I and Claude de France, Henry II had married Catherine de Medicis in 1533, well before acceding to the throne in 1547. His death in 1559 put an end to a reign which had maintained a spirit of competition with the Hapsburgs (Charles V, then Philip II) and an interest in the literary and artistic prestige championed by Francis I. The figure of Henry II in the left-hand border of the drawing associates Diana's crescent moon with the king's initial. It refers to the motto ""until it has filled his globe,"" which makes the phases of the moon the symbol of an aspiration towards the absolute-absolute monarchy in particular. The crowned double M and motto, on the other side, belongs to Catherine de Medicis.

The plaster model for this statue of the young king Henry IV of France was presented at the Salon of 1822. With this work, the neoclassical sculptor Bosio tried his hand at troubadour art - an intimate, anecdotal approach to history. The charm of the statue lies in its air of both youthfulness and gravity. The piece was extremely popular throughout the 19th century.
Henry IV under the Restoration
The prince, aged about ten, stands proudly, his left hand holding the pommel of his sword (broken and stolen in 1881), the right hanging loosely by his side. He is charmingly youthful and serious.This statue evokes Bourbon propaganda under the Restoration: the Bourbons used their glorious past, and the affective potential of Henry IV (founder of the dynasty), to enhance their public image. Bosio was a court favorite whatever the regime; he was portraitist to the imperial family under Napoleon I and court sculptor under Louis XVIII, before being granted the title of baron by Charles X.
The Troubadour style
Bosio was a neoclassical master who sculpted in the great tradition of Canova; this statue, an exception in his work, is an early and successful example of the Troubadour style, which influenced painting from the very start of the 19th century, but had a slighly later impact on sculpture. The precision of costume and accessories is characteristic of the Troubadour style, which views history from an anecdotal, intimate perspective, aiming to move the spectator (unlike neoclassical art, which seeks to edify). The portrayal of kings as children provides a touching contrast between the innocence of their state and the gravity of their destiny. Bosio was probably inspired by a 16th-century portrait of Henry IV at the age of four (Château de Versailles) by François Bunel (1522-1599), court painter to the kings of Navarre.Although the artist respected the antique tradition here by giving the sculpture a calm, impassive, and impersonal appearance, he also gave it the undeniable freshness which made the work so successful.
A phenomenal success
Bosio was given a commission for two marble statues: one for the king's residence (Château de Versailles), the other for the Château de Pau (birthplace of Henry IV). The silver statue in the Louvre was installed (unfinished) in the study of Louis XVIII on 25 August 1824, for the king's name day. Bosio obtained the privilege of making twelve bronze casts. The statuette was copied in a variety of materials throughout the 19th century (there is a brightly colored version in glazed terracotta made by Alfred Brault in the Château de Pau). Barbedienne produced many smaller replicas, thereby making the work available to a wider public.

This face with its impressive head of hair is that of the Numidian king Juba I. The idealization of the features suggests the influence of Hellenistic royal portraits, indicating that this was a posthumous portrait made during the reign of the king's son Juba II (reputed for his Greco-Roman culture). Juba I appears to be deified in this portrait by a likening to Jupiter.
A striking countenance
This imperious face is that of a middle-aged man, whose most striking feature is his abundant hair, which forms a heavy mass of twisted curls, arranged in rows. He is wearing a headband, which was a sign of royalty. A splendid beard also frames his face, whose discreet signs of age contribute to the impression of authority that emanates from the figure.
King Juba I
When this head was discovered in 1895, it was immediately identified as a portrait of King Juba I. This suggestion was confirmed after comparison with coins, on which portraits of the king display the same thick hair (which had made a great an impression on Cicero).Juba I, king of Numidia (a North African kingdom corresponding to the eastern part of modern Algeria), went down in Roman history when he sided with Pompey's partisans in the conflict between the consul and Caesar. The latter's victory in Thapsus in 46 BC sounded the knell for Pompey's party in Africa; Juba I committed suicide, and his kingdom became a Roman province called Africa Nova. His son, the future Juba II, was taken to Rome where he was raised and educated. 
A posthumous representation
The wrinkles on the sovereign's brow and the hollowed cheeks that accentuate his prominent cheekbones indicate his age, yet this portrait remains largely idealized. The noble features (those of a man in the prime of life) and headband around the hair come from the tradition of Hellenistic royal portraiture.This ideal character, strongly indebted to Greek art, suggests that the work was produced after the reign of Juba I. The portrait in the Louvre was probably a posthumous one, produced during the reign of Juba II, the sovereign whose Roman education left him steeped in Greco-Latin culture. He may therefore have honored his father by perhaps likening him to Jupiter.

This character with his royal headband is Juba II, sovereign of the Roman-ruled kingdom of Mauretania. Juba II was a scholarly prince who had been brought up at Caesar's court and was steeped in classical culture; his interest in Greek civilization is perceptible in this portrait, which owes a great deal to the Hellenistic sculptural tradition.
An aging prince
This full face portrait with high forehead and long, sunken cheeks, is framed by a mass of short, rather wild curls, held in place by a headband. The arch of the eyebrows overshadows the inner corner of the downward slanting eyes. The nose is broad, the mouth full and sensual, and there is a deep cleft in the chin.Despite the damage it has incurred, the features of this tired face are recognizable as those of Juba II at the age of about sixty. When the head was discovered it was immediately identified as such; this suggestion was confirmed after comparison with effigies on coins and other portraits of the prince, whose strong features, wide-set eyes, and thick hair are clearly recognizable. 
Juba II
Subsequent to the defeat and suicide of the Numidian king Juba I in 46 BC, his son was taken to Rome where he was raised by the sister of Octavian Augustus. The latter married him to Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, and granted him the regency of Mauretania (a territory comprising the western part of modern Algeria and Morocco). Juba II, who had been converted to classical culture by his Roman education, was a loyal vassal who did not betray the Roman cause. He settled in his capital Caesarea (modern Cherchell), whose very name was a homage to the master of Rome. More than anything he was an insatiably curious scholar and great art collector, who also wrote many historical and geographical treatises and organized scientific explorations to the Canary Islands and the sources of the Nile.
Hellenistic art
The classical culture of King Juba II is apparent in this portrait of the philhellenic king, which portrays him like a Hellenistic sovereign: beardless, short-haired, and wearing a royal headband. Hellenistic art also inspired the carefully modeled flesh and the idealization (which does not, however, overlook the subject's human qualities or ethnic group).Juba II apparently founded a very Hellenized artistic community in Caesarea, where excavations unearthed some impressive copies of Greek works (such as an Aphrodite, an Apollo, and a Demeter that are now conserved in Cherchell). Moreover, Juba II brought Greek artists from Egypt to his capital, thereby creating a school of sculpture that ensured the continuity of the Hellenistic sculptural tradition.

This is a retrospective statue of King Childebert I, son of Clovis, founder of the abbey of Sainte-Croix-Saint-Vincent, later named Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In fact, the sculptor probably executed the portrait of a 13th-century king. It is one of the earliest examples of the new style that flourished in Paris in the mid-13th century, epitomized by the statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle (between 1245 and 1248).
Tribute to the founders
It was common practice in the Middle Ages to adorn churches with retrospective statues, especially if they represented sovereigns or members of a royal family. The abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés had been founded (under the name de Sainte-Croix-Saint-Vincent) by Childebert I. It was all the more important to recall this fact since legend also claimed that this Merovingian king was a benefactor of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, which gave rise to a certain rivalry between the two churches. Consequently, a retrospective statue of Childebert was placed at the entrance to the abbey refectory, in the cloister. It stood along the path of the processions that passed through this room several times a day; the memory of the brotherhood's deceased benefactor was thus associated with their prayers. No other trace of the refectory has survived.
Description
The king is clad in a long tunic (originally blue) drawn in at the waist by a leather belt with metal ornaments. He once held a scepter (now mutilated) in his right hand, while his left hand (now lost) grasped the strap of a heavy cloak, on which a few traces of red can still be seen. On his head he wears a crown with four flowerets. The base and parts of the feet have been restored.
History
The construction of the refectory is sometimes attributed to the architect Pierre de Montreuil, who later built a Lady Chapel (now demolished) in the same abbey. Work began in 1239 and was completed in 1245. The date of execution of this statue must be somewhere between these two dates, for it is inextricably linked to the architecture: the column against which the statue stood, still visible on the back, was hewn out of the same block of stone. An 18th-century description states that it was placed in the center of the doorway in front of a pillar or pier, called a trumeau, supporting the tympanum. Given this date of execution, the statue is representative of the first stage of the stylistic metamorphosis that sculpture underwent in the mid-13th century. Until then, Parisian sculptors had remained faithful to drapery carved with tiny soft folds, associated with rather heavy-looking figures (Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois portal), most often distinguished by simple forms, moderate naturalism and the slightly angular drapery found during the same period in Amiens Cathedral. After 1240 sculptors suddenly showed much greater freedom in the play of volumes, more grace and character in their rendering of expressions, and a sort of casualness in their depiction of movements. Childebert's pleasant face, with elegantly curled hair and beard, is very similar to that of Christ on the central portal of Notre Dame de Paris. The pronounced arching of the chest and the somewhat affected gesture of the right hand herald features that would be found some years later in the Sainte-Chapelle, and during the third quarter of the 13th century in many works in the Parisian region, Champagne, and the north of France.

The Law Code of Hammurabi is the emblem of the Mesopotamian civilization. This high basalt stele erected by the king of Babylon in the 18th century BC is a work of art, history and literature, and the most complete legal compendium of Antiquity, dating back to earlier than the Biblical laws. Carried there by a prince from the neighboring country of Elam in Iran in the 12th century BC, the monument was exhibited on the Susa acropolis among other prestigious Mesopotamian masterpieces.

	A legal tradition

	This basalt stele was erected by King Hammurabi of Babylon (1792–1750 BC) probably at Sippar, city of the sun god Shamash, god of justice. Other monuments of this type belonging to a similar tradition were placed in the towns of his kingdom. Two Sumerian legal documents drawn up by Ur-Namma, king of Ur (c. 2100 BC) and Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c.1930 BC), precede the Law Code of Hammurabi. The Hammurabi Code—the most important legal compendium of the ancient Near East, drafted earlier than the Biblical laws—found its sources in these essays. The text, which occupies most of the stele, constitutes the raison d'être of the monument. The principal scene depicted shows the king receiving his investiture from Shamash. Remarkable for its legal content, this work is also an exceptional source of information about the society, religion, economy, and history of this period.

	The content of the Code

	The text is written in cuneiform script and the Akkadian language. It is divided into three parts:
	- a historical prologue relating the investiture of King Hammurabi in his role as ""protector of the weak and oppressed,"" and the formation of his empire and achievements;
	- a lyrical epilogue summing up his legal work and preparing its perpetuation in the future;
	- these two literary passages frame a text describing almost three hundred laws and legal decisions governing daily life in the kingdom of Babylon. The legal part of the text uses everyday language and is here simplified, for the king wanted it to be understood by all. However, the legal decisions are all constructed in the same manner: a phrase in the conditional sets out a problem of law or social order; it is followed by a response in the future tense, in the form of the sanction for the guilty party or the settlement of a situation: ""Should an individual do such and such a thing, such and such a thing will happen to him or her.""
	Grouped together in chapters, the issues addressed cover criminal and civil laws. The principal subjects are family law, slavery, and professional, commercial, agricultural and administrative law. Economic measures set prices and salaries. The longest chapter concerns the family, which formed the basis of Babylonian society. It deals with engagement, marriage and divorce, adultery and incest, children, adoption and inheritance, and the duties of children's nurses. Every aspect of each case is addressed, enabling the greatest number of observations to be made.

	The significance of the monument

	The Law Code of Hammurabi is valuable first and foremost as a model, being a treatise on the exercise of judiciary power in the context of Mesopotamian science, in which the particular never governs the general.
	The observation of several similar cases does not establish a general and universal principle, or law. It is not a code of laws in the sense that we understand it today, but rather a compendium of legal precedents. Contradictions and illogicalities (two similar cases causing different results) can be found in the Code, because it deals with particular judgements, from which the most personal elements (the names of the protagonists, for example) have been removed. Because justice was a royal prerogative in Mesopotamia, Hammurabi here sets out a selection of the wisest legal decisions that he had to take or ratify.
	This stele was, however, more than an educational tool. It was a code of the rules and prescriptions established by a sovereign authority, and therefore a code of laws. Not only does it contain a list of judicial rulings, but also a catalogue of the towns and territories annexed to the kingdom of Babylon. The stele of the Babylonian king Hammurabi constitutes a summary of one of the most prestigious reigns of ancient Mesopotamia. Executed in the last years of the sovereign's life, it was a political testament aimed at future princes, for whom it offered a model of wisdom and equity. The Code also served as a literary model for the schools of scribes, who were to copy it for over one thousand years.

Given to Cardinal Barberini by Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc in the early seventeenth century, the Barberini Ivory must already have been in Provence by the seventh century: on the back is a list of Barbarian kings and officials of the region. This is the only near-complete leaf of an imperial diptych to have come down to us. Its central section portrays the Emperor Anastasius (491-518) or, more likely, Justinian (527-565) in triumph, and its upper part, the glorification of Christ.   
The Barberini Ivory: a near-complete imperial diptych
This is the only near-complete leaf of an imperial diptych to have come down to us. The leaves were composed of five separate elements. Here only the right-hand plaque is missing: like the others it was held in place around the central plaque by a tongue and groove system that made possible the considerable width of the leaf as a whole.The back of the leaf is inscribed with the names of officials of the seventh-century kingdom of Austrasia. Kept in Provence at this time, it was rediscovered in the home of the scholar of Aix-en-Provence, Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc, in the seventeenth century. The diptych owes its name to Cardinal Barberini, to whom Peiresc gave it as a gift. 
View of a triumph
The center of the diptych is occupied by a carving in high relief of the triumph of a mounted emperor. To his right, but now lost, an allegory of Victory, set on a globe engraved with a cross, held out a crown to him. A spear in the horseman's right hand is planted in the ground to hold back a bearded figure - a Persian or Scythian, it would seem, judging by the clothing and cap. Sitting beneath the horse's hoofs, a woman symbolizing the Earth holds the emperor's right foot in a gesture of submission. In the upper section, a bust of Christ administering a blessing is flanked by Winged Victories. On the left, a soldier is preparing to give the horseman a statuette of Victory bearing a laurel wreath. At the bottom, the vanquished have come to pay tribute to their conqueror. The overall composition is dominated by the triumphal scene and the omnipotence of the Byzantine emperor.
Justinian, Constantine, or Anastasius?
Despite a marked resemblance to portraits of Constantine (324-340), the emperor shown here would seem to be Justinian (527-565), given the period indicated by the style of the piece. Some commentators have opted for Anastasius (491-518), second husband of the empress Ariadne (d. 515). The two ivory figures of empresses - both identified as Ariadne - in the Vienna Museum and the Bargello (National Museum of Sculpture) in Florence have undeniable affinities with the central section of the Barberini Ivory, especially in that they are virtually sculpted in the round. However, the stylistic differences do not allow for any definite correlation, and the leaf in the Louvre seems a little later. Such factors as analogies with the reliefs on the episcopal throne in Ravenna, and the association of Christ administering a blessing with a Byzantine emperor - attested on the Consul Justin diptych, with its medallions of Justinian, Christ, and the empress Theodora, side by side - mean the Barberini Ivory can be attributed to the Constantinople workshops of the second quarter of the sixth century. This would thus seem to be a triumphal portrait of Justinian who, in 532, signed a ""peace treaty"" with the Persians.

This portrait of Livia, wife of Augustus, belongs to the tradition of Roman Republican portraiture and illustrates the classicizing style that triumphed during the reign of Augustus. This official portrait served the propaganda of the essentially monarchist regime installed during the late first century BC under cover of a restoration of the Republic (59-27 BC). Judging by the material - basanite - it dates from Octavian's victory over Mark Anthony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 BC.
The wife of Augustus
This basanite head is a portrait of Livia (born circa 57 BC, died in AD 29), comparable to her effigies on coins and hardstone cameos (such as the one in The Hague). Livia, a member of the Roman nobility, played a major role in the foundation of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Her children from a first marriage to a member of the Claudian family were adopted by Octavian Augustus, whom she married in 38 BC before he became emperor.
Reference to Republican portraiture
This work is a fine example of the propaganda of the new regime, which claimed to be a mere restoration of the Republic rather than a monarchy. In reality, almost all power (political, military, and religious) was now in the hands of one man: Augustus. Livia's hairstyle is one that was highly fashionable from the mid-first century BC: a roll of hair (""nodus,"" in Latin) over her forehead, with a little bun at the nape of the neck and a short central braid (hidden by a veil in this portrait). The austere features link this face to traditional Republican portraiture, which served to vaunt the merits of the ruling class. The work also illustrates the classicizing style that triumphed during the reign of Augustus (27 BC-AD 14): official portraits were idealized in reference to fifth-century BC Athenian classicism, thereby expressing Augustus' desire to affirm the restoration of a ""golden age.""
Egyptian inspiration
Basanite is an extremely hard material that gives an almost metallic sheen to this head, so that it resembles bronze portraits from the same period. However, the hieratic quality, the strictly frontal presentation, and the refinement of the material also recall the royal art of Hellenistic Egypt. This has been interpreted as a deliberate reference to Octavian's seizure of the kingdom of Cleopatra VII after his victory over Mark Anthony and the Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Actium. This portrait probably dates to the period just after that battle, circa 30 BC, when Livia was 27 years old.

This portrait was commissioned as a gift for Philip V of Spain. However, it was such a success at court that it was never sent to Spain. Every detail of the work is aimed at producing the quintessential image of absolute power: the nobility of the antique setting, the crimson curtain, and the solemnity of the Sun King wearing his coronation robes embroidered with the royal fleur de lys. 
Louis XIV
Louis XIV (1638-1715), the son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, was one of France's most important monarchs. He ruled from 1643 to 1715 and was known as the Sun King. His childhood was marked by the political troubles of the Fronde, so throughout his reign he sought to maintain the unity of the kingdom at all cost, crushing any moves the aristocracy made to obtain extra power. In 1660 he married Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1661, after the death of Cardinal Mazarin, finally free of his influence, Louis XIV wielded absolute power, but was shrewd enough to surround himself with devoted and talented ministers such as Colbert, Louvois, and Vauban. The royal purse, the army, industry, and administration were all reformed and trade blossomed. Louis XIV also greatly encouraged the arts. The château of Versailles is the finest achievement of his reign.
The king's coronation robes
At the time of the portrait, Louis XIV was 63 years old. He is shown wearing his coronation robes, the royal sword at his side, and holding the royal scepter. The crown is on a stool beside him. The painting of the robes is particularly detailed and refined, if somewhat overdone, reminding the viewer of the king's greatness. Other artists from Rigaud's studio must have worked on some parts of the painting, but the king's face - painted on paper mounted on the finished canvas - was the work of Rigaud himself, who produced a lifelike yet noble portrait.
A commission for the king of Spain
Louis XIV in fact commissioned the portrait as a gift for his grandson Philip V of Spain. The painting was shown at the 1704 Salon and then became part of the Louis XIV Collection. It remained in the royal collections until after the Revolution, when in 1793 it was handed over to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.

The bust is a (probably posthumous) portrait of Marcus Aurelius, emperor from AD 161 to 180. The technical skill, notably in the treatment of the hair and beard, typifies the so-called baroque style that was fashionable during the second century AD. This, together with the subject's enraptured expression and colossal dimensions, served to transfigure the emperor's image, emphasizing his elevated rank and exceptional character.
The emperor Marcus Aurelius
This colossal head, mounted on a modern bust, represents Marcus Aurelius, who reigned from AD 161 to 180. The large, protruding eyes and skillfully rendered mass of hair and beard are familiar features of portraits of this philosopher emperor.
A daughter's homage to her father
The portrait is one of a pair with the similarly-sized bust of Lucius Verus, co-emperor from AD 161 to 169. Both come from a villa belonging to Lucius Verus, in Acqua Traversa near Rome. The magnified, larger-than-life representation suggests that this was a posthumous portrait of the emperor, probably commissioned by his daughter Lucilla, the wife of Lucius Verus. The portrait was probably made sometime between the death of Marcus Aurelius in AD 180 and that of Lucilla in AD 183.
Masterly portraiture from the Nervan-Antonian dynasty
This portrait is exceptional for its size and state of preservation. It is also one of the most striking expressions of the baroque style, fashionable in the Roman empire during the late second century, and which represented a complete break with classical tradition. The exaggerated volumes of the hair and beard, deeply sculpted by the artist, contrast with the remarkable smoothness of the face; the two huge eyes, raised heavenward, give the emperor an enraptured expression. Naturalistic representation seems to have been deliberately abandoned during this period, in order to promote imperial interests by emphasizing the emperor's elevated status and character.

The mirror is decorated on the back with a portrait of the young Louis XIII on his marriage to Anne of Austria in 1615. The border depicts birds, flowers, and foliage in enamel on metal foil, with a crown above. The mirror was made at a time when Limoges was increasing its production of small items, sometimes linked, like the present work, to current events.
A mirror with an inner compartment
The mirror opens onto a compartment where a love token or lock of hair can be kept. It also has a ring, allowing it to be hung from a belt on a chain. Small enamels were also used to decorate pendants and watchcases. The subjects depicted might be mythological, religious, or, as here, profane.
The portrait
This portrait of the fifteen-year-old Louis XIII closely matches contemporary engravings of his marriage to the young Anne of Austria in November 1615. Enamels featuring portraits of his bride exist with similar borders. The wedding itself is depicted on an enamel in the British Museum in London, done after an engraving dating from the engagement in 1612, in which the two adolescents look much younger. 
The enameler
The mirror is unsigned. Two enamelers are known to have produced portraits of the royal family in the first third of the seventeenth century. The first, who portrayed Henri IV and Marie de' Medici on salts now at the Musée d'Angers, signed his work IC and must be Jehan Court, called Vigier. The second, who signed his work IL, made the little portrait of Louis XIII at the age of around twenty-five now in the Wallace Collection in London. The style of the border allows this mirror to be attributed to the second of the two, who might be either the Jehan Limosin who signed the Esther and Ahasuerus plate, or the Joseph Limosin who signed a salt now in the Louvre, enamelers with both these forenames being documented for the first half of the seventeenth century.

One of the most distinctive features of the Amorite palace at Mari is its painted decoration. Many rooms and courtyards retain the traces of pictorial decoration, most often in the form of decorative motifs but sometimes in the form of large figurative compositions. Of these very fragile works it has been possible to reconstruct the famous Investiture of Zimri-Lim, showing a scene in which the king does homage to the goddess Ishtar, at the center of a composition representing the Mari palace.
The investiture of the king of Mari
The Investiture of Zimri-Lim is the only Near Eastern pictorial composition of the second millennium BC in the format of a framed panel rather than a frieze. What is more, it was discovered still in place, on its original wall, to the right of the great doorway that gives onto the podium room (Room 64), the antechamber to the throne room (Room 65). The south wall of Court 106 had the painting of the Director of the Sacrifice, part of which may be seen at the Louvre (AO 19825). The principal theme of the Investiture painting - a divinity, in this case Ishtar, offering the king the scepter and staff, the insignia of rule - is also represented on other monuments, such as the Code of Hammurabi (Sb 8).On the two symmetrical side panels are subsidiary elements: the goddess Lama interceding, a palm, a composite tree, fabulous guardian animals. The symbolism (jets of water, plants, the gathering of dates) highlights the assurance of fertility the king in his palace is meant to provide. The warlike aspect of Ishtar with her lion - positioned exactly in the middle of the painting - is counterbalanced by the dove, an attribute of her pacific and loving aspect. The human-headed bull, the griffin, and the sphinx prefigure the colossal door-guardians of Neo-Assyrian palaces such as that at Khorsabad.
A depiction of the interior of the Mari palace
The painting echoes the architecture in which it was placed. The two registers of the middle panel represent an enfilade of ceremonial chambers of identical size and an area open to the skies.The throne room of the palace was in fact accessed through a room of  very similar size. This housed a podium, at the foot of which was found the body of a statue of a goddess. She held a vase, from which, thanks to a plumbing system, there flowed real water, as shown in the painting.The duplication of the statue in the painted panel may be explained by an artistic convention that required, as in the case of heraldic motifs, the symmetrical depiction of the two profiles of a figure. The space between the two representations of the statue gives a view to the farther room where the ceremony of royal investiture takes place. The side panels represent the vast Court 106, in the center of which the excavations revealed an arrangement to support the trunk of the palm-tree, presumably artificial, that is mentioned in the texts.
Recent restoration
The nature of the ground, a skin of whitewash or plaster on the mud plaster of the wall of unbaked brick, the fresco secco technique (true fresco appearing in Crete in the early second millennium BC), and the humid conditions meant that such paintings were poorly preserved in the region.Furthermore, the Investiture painting was considerably darkened and damaged when Hammurabi of Babylon set fire to the city in around 1760 BC, causing the complete destruction of its monuments.As part of the reorganization of the display at the Louvre, this painting was recently cleaned and cleared of the repainting done in previous restorations, revealing hitherto unknown details (fish in the jetting water, the scalloped hem of the king's robe, etc.) and in places restoring an unexpected vibrancy to the colors (one of the bulls still being a vivid orange).

Thanks to its original antique inscription, this figure can be definitely identified as Alexander the Great, son of Philip II of Macedon. The leonine hair brushed up from the forehead is characteristic of portraits of the Macedonian sovereign. The work is a copy of the head of a work from 330 BC attributed to Lysippos - doubtless the statue of Alexander with a bronze lance mentioned by Plutarch (Moralia, 360 d). The Louvre's small bronze, Br 370, is another copy of the same work.
Alexander the Great
This work takes the form of a herm: a pillar whose upper part has been sculpted in the shape of a head. It shows a young man, his head slightly lifted. The features are idealized, but there is a a degree of individualization in his inspired expression, and the mane of hair falling in strands on his forehead. The authenticity of the antique inscription - which identifies the bust as that of Alexander the Great -  is open to discussion, but the physiognomy of the figure leaves no doubt. The particular arrangement of the hair is well attested in other images of the Macedonian conqueror.
A diplomatic gift?
This bust was part of a gallery of herms featuring portraits of famous men,  unearthed in 1779 during an excavation at Tivoli organized by Joseph Nicolas Azara, the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See and, later, to France. For a time, this was the only known portrait of Alexander the Great; the value and significance of Azara's gift of it to Napoleon Bonaparte was, then, considerable. The date of the presentation is uncertain: according to some texts, Azara intended to offer it as a diplomatic gift during the negotiations surrounding the Armistice of Bologna in 1796, as a gauge of the Holy See's good will towards . Nevertheless, the inscription tells us that Napoleon received the herm during his time as First Consul, ie. not before 1803, the year in which he gave the work to the Louvre (as indicated by the inscription on the right-hand side of the pillar). The inscription, together with Bonaparte's other imperial symbols, was probably made after his downfall in 1815.
The echo of a lost statue
This bust was badly damaged during its time underground, and has been extensively restored. It is, nevertheless, the portrait of Alexander that comes closest to the work of Lysippos, a Greek artist of the fourth century BC. Lysippos's fame is due as much to his works in bronze as to his status as Alexander's official portraitist. Contemporary sources tell us that the sovereign authorized only three such artists: the sculptor Lysippos, the gem-engraver Pyrgoteles, and the painter Apelles. No direct trace of Lysippos's work has come down to us. Most antique bronze statues disappeared long ago, and are known only through small bronze copies or Roman versions in marble. The Azara Herm and the bronze Br 370 are copies of the same original, created by Lysippos around 330 BC. Alexander is shown looking upwards, as if to challenge the gods themselves. This vision of the inspired ruler, widely copied by Alexander's successors and imitators, became a standard model for Hellenistic royal portraiture.

Son of Charles d'Angoulême and Louise de Savoie, and cousin of King Louis XII whom he succeeded to the throne in 1515, François I wears the pendant of the Order of Saint Michael, which he served as Grand Master. The king's face is identical to an existing drawing by Clouet (Musée Condé, Chantilly). The modernity of the portrait is evident in the monumental and physical character of the bust, as well as the importance given to the hands; the date of execution has been judged at 1527-30.
Flemish realism and Italian influence
Following the example of the composition of Fouquet's Portrait of Charles VII, Jean Clouet depicts François I fully facing the viewer and casting a noble gaze. The king is richly attired in Italian style, but depicted without crown or scepter, the emblems of his station. The head, very slightly stylized, is precise in its details, painted after a drawing by Jean Clouet found today in the Chantilly museum. Despite the persistent realism of the Flemish school, everything in this painting is reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance artists: the subtle light, the shading of the face and hands, the realism of the folds in the clothing, the brilliance of the jewelry, and, of course, the framing - inspired as much by Fouquet as by Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci.
The Fontainebleau school
The Fontainebleau school, whose aesthetics were partly imported from Italy by Louis XII and François I, became the dominant influence in the French court of the 16th century. The school is characterized by a taste for the decorative, for ornament, mythological scenes, and sensual depictions of the female body. Its beginnings can be traced to the presence of the Italian artists Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio and Niccolo dell'Abbate during the construction of the Château de Fontainebleau, from 1526. Two Fontainebleau schools are generally distinguished: the first was influential during the reign of François I and Henri II, while the second corresponds to the artistic renewal that took place under Henri IV. 
François I, patron of the arts
During the period when this portrait of François I (1494-1547) was painted, probably around 1535, the conqueror of Marignan had already surmounted the political difficulties ensuing from his defeat at Pavia and his imprisonment at the hands of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. While reinforcing his political power, François I established a patronage of a breadth never before seen in France. The portrait remained in the Royal Collections after its commission from Clouet and subsequent delivery to the king. It entered the Louvre with the Royal Collections at the formation of the Muséum Central des Arts in 1793. It is customarily believed that the portrait was painted with the collaboration of François Clouet, the artist's son.

This blunt, straighforward portrait of the emperor Gallienus was created at the beginning of his reign, when he inherited a significantly weakened Roman Empire. The portrait's typology indicates the emperor's desire to project himself as an inspired, powerful leader. This effigy was clearly intended as a piece of authoritarian propaganda. Through its borrowings from the Greek sculptural canon, it is also the artistic testimony of an emperor who was a noted lover of Greek culture.
The emperor Gallienus
This head, originally part of a statue or a bust, is a portrait of the Roman emperor Gallienus, who reigned as co-emperor with his father Valerian from AD 253, and alone from AD 261-268. The very blunt expression leaves no doubt as to his identity: the broad forehead, the aquiline nose and the pronounced furrow in the upper lip are all prominent traits familiar from Imperial portraits and coinage produced during Gallienus's reign.
The portrait as a political tool
This type of portrait would have been created after Gallienus became sole emperor, when his father was taken prisoner by the Persians. In a crisis-ridden Empire, whose unity was threatened by barbarian invasions and challenges to Imperial authority from individual provinces, Gallienus sought to reassert the emperor's power. Portraits such as this present him as an authoritarian and resolute man. The inspired upward gaze emphasizes his visionary strength: Gallienus is depicted as an enlightened leader capable of restoring order and prosperity. The portrait is clearly intended to serve the emperor's political aspirations; distributed throughout the empire in the form of statuary and on coins, it became an instrument of propaganda.  
The ""Gallienic Renaissance""
The reign of Gallienus was marked by a return to Hellenic tastes. The emperor, steeped in Greek culture, thought of himself as a Philhellenist, like Hadrian. Gallienus was interested in the Neo-Platonist philosophy of Plotinus, and was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries - secret rituals held annually at Eleusis in honor of the goddesses Persephone and Demeter. In portraiture, this renewed interest in Greek civilization inspired the emergence of a particular typology, characterized by abundant hair and an upturned gaze, and directly inspired by Hellenistic of images of Alexander the Great and his successors. The simple, formalized composition of the head is also reminiscent of classicizing art, and portraits of the divine Augustus.At the same time, the portrait shows a tendency towards schematization, notably in the treatment of the hair and in block-like, structured forms of the face. The trend towards greater abstraction in art, evident in Imperial portraits of the third century, is used here to reinforce Gallienus's imperious expression and glorify his character.

Queen Tiye, the Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep III, once stood beside the king, of whom only the right arm remains. The royal couple was carved from a block of very soft stone called steatite, and embellished with bright green enamel.
	The Great Royal Wife was very often portrayed and mentioned during the reign of Amenhotep III. Tiye is represented next to the king in many official portraits, and her name is often included in commemorative royal texts.

	Tiye

	This incomplete statuette represents Queen Tiye adorned with royal emblems: a vulture skin partly covering her long wig is topped by a tall cap decorated with two long feathers; her left hand, raised to her waist, grasps the floral scepter. She once stood next to her royal husband Amenhotep III, of whom only the right arm remains, wearing arm and wrist bracelets. The columns of text inscribed on the back pillar contain their royal titularies.

	A deified royal couple

	This work is a perfect example of the artistic style of the reign of Amenhotep. The figure is slender, with small round breasts set rather low, a tiny waist, slightly rounded belly, and wider thighs than hips. A characteristic of the work of artists from the reign of Amenhotep III is the extremely youthful faces. Tiye is no exception, with her round face, large and slightly prominent almond-shaped eyes, turned-up nose, and full lips.

	She wears a close-fitting tunic with shoulder straps, covered by a feather garment which was one of the attributes of a goddess and indicates her accession to the world of the gods. Amenhotep had a temple built for his own cult in Soleb (in Nubia), and another dedicated to Tiye in nearby Sedeinga. This small monument in enameled stone thus represents the deified royal couple.

	The tribulations of an artwork

	Thanks to Champollion, the Musée Royal du Louvre acquired the Salt collection in 1826. It featured some 4000 items—including the lower part of the body of Queen Tiye, which was then stolen during the revolution of July 1830. A few months later, it was mysteriously returned to its place in the Louvre's department of Egyptian Antiquities.
	In 1962, the upper part of the statuette turned up on the art market! The Société des Amis du Louvre bought it and gave it to the museum, where it was fitted back onto the first fragment. Perhaps the statuette of Amenhotep III will one day return to join his Great Wife…!

This impressive head, which originally topped a colossal statue, depicts the Emperor Septimius Severus. After the excesses of Commodus, his reign was supposed to restore order. However, this work is marked by the baroque style characteristic of the preceding dynasty: baroque tempered by the schematized formalism of the provincial art of the period. The portrait, discovered in Algeria, documents the artistic production outside of Rome as well as the loyalty of a provincial city toward the power
An emperor born in Africa
This colossal head depicts the founder of the Severus dynasty, Septimius Severus, whose reign lasted from 193 to 211 BC. Born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya and elected emperor by his soldiers, Septimius Severus was an adept of eastern cults. His wife Julia Domna, a Syrian princess, was the daughter of a high priest of Baal. Here the emperor had himself portrayed as a devotee of the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis, the Greek form of the Apis bull; the cork-screw ringlets that adorn his forehead are adopted from depictions of the deity.
Abandoning naturalism
The head itself is sculpted in an expressive style. The stylized features make the face imposing, while the upcast eyes impart an ecstatic quality which, although more moderate here than in the period of Commodus, is characteristic of  the baroque style of the early 3rd century BC. The sculptor’s chisel carved the hair and the beard rigidly and mechanically, which unpolished treatment contrasts with that used for the smooth and luminous planes of the flesh. This contrast effect is once again indicative of the art of the late 2nd century. Renouncing naturalism in this manner is in keeping with a political and religious ideology aimed at portraying the emperor as an extraordinary being.
A portrait ""gallery""
The head, as well as the portrait of Julia Domna (MA 1104), belong to a group of imperial effigies discovered in the ancient city of Verecunda in Algeria. This provincial origin explains the work’s rather rustic execution, which one also finds to a greater or lesser degree in the other portraits of the group. In fact, this ensemble constitutes the output of different artists working at different dates; what’s more, the means and tastes of those who commissioned these works might have led them to opt for artists who were more or less familiar with the Roman sculptural tradition. Thus, the Verecunda portraits form a group of inconsistent quality, but one representative of the relationship between official statuary and local tradition.

This jewellery was modified over time to the tastes of Queen Hortense, Queen Marie-Amélie, and Isabelle of Orleans. It remained in the Orleans family until 1985. Although a number of portraits of the illustrious owners wearing the jewels are known, little is known about where they originated. Neither the artist nor the person who commissioned the pieces have been identified. However, the jewels are a precious testimony to the history of jewellery-making in Paris.

	Technical perfection

	The set consists of a diadem, a necklace, a pair of earrings and two small and one large brooch. All are set with Ceylon sapphires in their natural state - in other words, they have not been heat-treated to change their colour as is generally the case in jewellery-making today. The sapphires are ringed with diamonds set in gold. All the links of the necklace are articulated, reflecting the technical perfection of the set as a whole. The diadem was probably reduced in size between 1863 and 1873, as indicated by a comparison of the portrait of Marie-Amélie by Louis Hersent (1863, chateau of Versailles, on loan to the chateau of Compiègne) and the photographic portrait of Isabelle of Orleans, Duchesse of Guise (private collection). The comparison reveals that the diadem has changed slightly in the later portrait. The number of brooches now in the set is not the same as in the Hersent portrait, although this may be explained by the fact that parts of the diadem could be taken out and worn separately as a brooch.

	An illustrious history

	The earliest written record of this jewellery is in a letter relating to its purchase sent by the duke of Orleans, later King Louis-Philippe, to Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837), queen of Holland and later Duchess of Saint-Leu, its then owner. The jewellery was worn by Queen Marie-Amélie of France (1782-1866), who divided the set among her grandchildren as they married. Louis-Philippe, Count of Paris (1838-1894), the son of the duke of Orleans (1810-1842), bequeathed it to Philippe, Duke of Orleans (1869-1926), Isabelle of Orleans, duchess of Guise (1878-1961), and his successor as Count of Paris, who sold it to the Louvre in 1985.

	The mystery of the jewels

	It is generally believed that Queen Hortense acquired the jewellery from the Empress Josephine. However, there is no real proof of this. An Orleans family tradition that the jewels once belonged to Marie Antoinette complicates matters even further. It is difficult to obtain any firm proof about the past history of the jewels, which means that it is almost impossible to date them. The identity of the maker (or makers) is likewise unknown, partly because of the numerous additions and modifications that the jewellery has undergone. None of the pieces bear the hallmarks of any of the most respected jewellers of the nineteenth century - Nitot, Bapst, and Marguerite - who often worked for the royal family. Despite the mystery that surrounds it, the set of jewellery, named after the two queens who once owned it, Marie-Amélie and Hortense, is a remarkable tribute to the skills of Parisian jewellers in the early years of the nineteenth century.

In the 16th century, fine weaponry became popular in the great courts of Europe. The house of Valois spent lavishly on ceremonial weapons. The helmet (MR 426) and shield belonging to Charles IX (1550–1574) were made by the goldsmith Pierre Redon. They are among the few surviving examples of fine weaponry from the French Renaissance.

	The goldsmith's art

	The shield and matching helmet were the work of Pierre Redon, who was goldsmith to the Valois court and valet to the king. We know they are the work of Pierre Redon thanks to records showing that his widow, Marie de Fourcroy, received payment for them in 1572. Both the shield and the helmet are outstanding examples of the goldsmith's art. The shield is made of embossed iron, plated with gold and decorated in places with enamels in translucent green, red, and blue and opaque white. The enameled ornamentation is applied in light touches on the raised parts of the embossed shield. The reverse side is covered in crimson velvet embroidered with arabesques of gold thread.

	Battle scene

	In the center of the shield is a medallion depicting a battle scene, with soldiers on horseback in combat outside a besieged citadel and a camp. This is a depiction of the final battle between Marius (157–86 BC) and Jugurtha (160–104 BC), as the Latin inscription indicates. The Roman consul defeated the Numidian army, and King Jugurtha, abandoned by his supporters, was captured and taken to Rome. The choice of this scene is a reminder of the influence of Greek and Roman antiquity on the Renaissance. Apart from the battle scene, the whole shield is edged with a frieze of a laurel garland interspersed with thirty-two cloisonné enamel and gold medallions featuring alternately flowers and the letter K for Karolus (Charles in Latin).

	Ornamentation borrowed from the School of Fontainebleau

	Between the central medallion and the trim round the edge, the shield is decorated with various motifs: scrolls, intertwining patterns, war trophies, rinceaux, sprays of fruit, grotesque masks, and friezes. Above the medallion are the head of the Medusa and two groups of defeated warriors on cannons taken as trophies. Typical of Mannerism and the first School of Fontainebleau, these motifs match the historical depiction of the battle. The model for this ornamentation is unknown, although it is very similar to engravings by Etienne Delaune.

Jacques Louis David was commissioned by Napoleon I to paint this huge canvas which depicts the splendor of the emperor’s Coronation while conveying its political and symbolic message. The painter himself was present at the ceremony, and once back in his studio portrayed the colorful congregation with realism, combining accuracy with artistry while also complying with the Emperor’s instructions. He thus met the challenge of producing a monumental work that would glorify the event and occupy a unique place in the history of painting.
A double coronation
Having won military prestige with his victorious campaigns in Italy and Egypt, Napoleon took power as First Consul after the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire. In May 1804 he was proclaimed Emperor, and a coronation ceremony was held on December 2 of the same year at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris to secure his imperial legitimacy and root his authority in the French monarchic and Catholic tradition. Moreover—like Charlemagne some 1000 years before—he was consecrated emperor by a pope. However, Napoleon crowned himself, facing the congregation rather than the high altar to mark his independence from the Church. Although David's initial sketch represented the Emperor in the act of crowning himself, the final painting shows him crowning the Empress—a gesture that presents a nobler, less authoritarian image, described by Napoleon himself as that of a ""French knight.""
A blend of art and history
David drew inspiration for the layout of his painting from Rubens's Coronation of Marie de Medici (in the Louvre). He witnessed the ceremony first-hand and had most of its participants pose for him, also reconstructing the scene in his purpose-built studio with cardboard models and wax figurines. He highlighted the protagonists by placing them in the center and illuminating them with a beam of light. The arcade provides an imposing frame for the imperial couple, also set off by the surrounding colorful congregation. The Pope sits to the right among cardinals and bishops. The great dignitaries of the Empire are shown in three-quarter back view in the right foreground, bearing symbols of imperial power: the eagle-topped scepter, the globe, and the hand of Justice. The Emperor's two brothers and two sisters are represented on the left, while Napoleon's mother looks down on the scene from her vantage point in the VIP gallery. All eyes are turned toward the crown, which the painter highlighted against a section of green curtain that overlaps the pilaster. The profile of the kneeling Joséphine—made to look younger for the occasion—stands out against the lovely yellow ocher of the cross-bearer’s cope, just in front of Marshal Murat, who is portrayed holding the coronation cushion. David used an exceptionally rich palette of colors to depict the velvets, furs, satins, and lamés of the costumes and furnishings.
""One walks in this picture""
This painting—which is also a group portrait of the imperial family, the court, and the clergy dressed in ceremonial costume—is totally realistic in appearance. Yet David took certain liberties with history and protocol: he downsized the structure of Notre-Dame Cathedral to give the figures greater impact; on Napoleon’s orders, he included Letizia Bonaparte (“Madame Mère”) in his painting, although she had not attended the coronation ceremony, of which she disapproved; again on the Emperor’s instructions, he portrayed the Pope making a gesture of blessing, having originally represented him with his hands on his knees; and the Emperor’s sisters stand immobile, though they held the Empress's train at the ceremony itself. These various artistic solutions, designed to suit this monumental painting and its fascinating hero, fully satisfied the Emperor: ""What relief, what truthfulness! This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" David realized the significance of this work for the future and for his personal fame, saying ""I shall slide into posterity in the shadow of my hero.""

This bust of the emperor Trajan corresponds to an archetype created at the beginning of his reign, which brought a troubled period to an end. This context explains the obvious reference to portraits of Augustus: the emperor's serene countenance, constructed according to the classical principles of balance and moderation, reflects his desire to introduce a new era of stability and prosperity to the Roman Empire.
Trajan (AD 98-117)
This bust, which is truncated at mid-torso in accordance with a new development in Roman portraiture, represents the emperor Trajan in heroic nudity. The short hair is styled forward into a full fringe, divided in the middle. The face, turned to the left, looks stern with its fixed expression and tight mouth. Wrinkles at the corner of the eyes and folds in the neck represent signs of age in an otherwise idealized portrait.
Optimus princeps
The emperor Nerva chose Trajan, an officer in the Roman army, as his successor. This adoption procedure put an end to the crises of succession that had occurred within the hereditary dynasties, threatening the stability of the Empire during the latter half of the first century AD. In this troubled context, Trajan's image needed to be reassuring, perceived as a guarantee of stability; it therefore borrowed directly from Augustan iconography in an obvious symbolic maneuver. A certain resemblance is indeed apparent in the hairstyle and clean contours of the portrait.This work was therefore intended as an expression of political ideology as well as a representation of the prince's moral qualities: his calm, resolute expression suggests self-control, a quality not shared by his arrogant and immoderate predecessors. This portrait already presented Trajan as the ""optimus princeps"" (the best of princes), a title bestowed upon him in AD 113: a man of honor in the service of Rome, and a rigorous, exemplary officer.
A return to classicism
This portrait is one of a series derived from an archetype created in the official Roman workshops, which dates, judging by the hairstyle, from the beginning of Trajan's reign. The rendering of the hair in precisely chiseled, triangular locks indicates that the original was a bronze. The quality of the bust in the Louvre suggests it was produced in an official workshop, at a date close to that of the prototype.Apart from the symbolic reference to the image of Augustus, the idealization of the subject recalls Augustan classicism: an economy of means (perceptible in the simple rendering of the smooth, luminous flesh, and the simple marble ridge that indicates the eyebrows) gives the work its grandeur and majesty. The naturalistic details such as wrinkles and folds in the neck recall the art of the Flavian period, however. This portrait is therefore a veritable synthesis - the expression of a certain naturalism, together with the symbolic inheritance of Augustan classicism.

This bas-relief comes from the tomb of Sethos I - the largest in the Valley of the Kings. The goddess Hathor is shown welcoming the king: she clasps his hand, and holds out her necklace as a symbol of her protection. Thebes was the capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the goddess played an important role in the necropolis area, welcoming the dead and accompanying them into the afterlife. The traditional hieratic quality of Egyptian drawing is tempered by a certain softness here.
Lady of the West
This bas-relief, enhanced with a rich polychromy, was part of the decoration of the tomb of King Sethos I, carved into the cliffs in the Valley of the Kings, west of Thebes. The goddess Hathor, Lady of the West (the underworld), welcomes Sethos into her domain. She holds out her menat necklace as a symbol of her protection, and takes his hand. The rigorous symmetry of this face-to-face encounter is softened by the attitudes of the two figures. Hathor stands straight and still, whereas the king seems to be moving, leaning slightly toward her, his legs in a walking position. Both figures are named by the hieroglyphs inscribed on the upper part of the relief. Their functions and qualities are confirmed by specific attributes: on the goddess's wig are the horns of a cow (her sacred animal) and a solar disk (she is the daughter of Ra), while the royal uraeus cobra stands out in front of the king's forehead.
An echo of the Amarna style
This scene corresponds to the strict conventions of traditional drawing, yet there are traces of the Amarna style that prevailed fifty years before in the design of the hands, the flowing strands of the king's wig, and his sandal-clad feet (shown in ""true profile"").The characters' finery reflects the refinement and elegance of the art from this period: Hathor's sophisticated headdress, the flow of her tunic, the lightness and transparency of the king's clothing. The jewelry has the colors of the precious materials from which it was made: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and carnelian.
Champollion
During Champollion's expedition to Egypt with the Italian Rossellini, he removed this relief (which was already somewhat damaged) from the tomb of Sethos I, and brought it back to the Louvre. Unfortunately, his untimely death in 1832 prevented him from seeing it restored and exhibited in his Egyptian department at the Musée Charles X (link history of the Palais).

This head is the only known sculpted portrait of the emperor Theodosius II. The hieratic quality and schematization of its features are characteristic of a tendency that emerged in Roman art from the third century onward, and which became firmly established during the late fourth century. This new approach to portraiture gave the emperor a spiritual, timeless dimension which reflects the power of his role as a political and religious leader.
An imperial portrait
The subject's imperial status is emphasized by a finely detailed gold-plated diadem. His hair is styled in a thick fringe over his forehead, its strands indicated by vertical incisions.The long face is dominated by the rapt gaze of the huge eyes, whose impact is amplified by deeply hollowed pupils and finely sculpted, arched eyebrows.
Theodosius II and the Eastern Roman Empire
The head's resemblance to portraits of other members of the Theodosian house identifies it as the only known sculpted representation of Theodosius II, emperor of the East from AD 408 to 450. When Theodosius I died in 395, the Roman Empire was divided into two parts. The Western empire was gradually carved up following the barbarian invasions, and finally disappeared when the last Western emperor died in 476; however, the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) empire survived as a functioning political entity until the Turkish conquest of 1453.By the time of Theodosius, the emperor's role had changed beyond recognition in comparison to the early days of the empire. Theodosius II ruled as an absolute monarch, and launched an unprecedented effort to codify all Roman imperial legislation since the year AD 312  - resulting in the so-called Theodosian Code, published in 438. The emperor was also the temporal head of the Eastern Christian church; in 431, he summoned the Council of Ephesus, which proclaimed Mary as the Mother of God.
The demise of classical art
Imperial portraits made in the last days of the Roman empire reflect the new ideology of power. The sober style and hieratic quality of this representation transfigured the emperor's image, giving him a timeless, spiritualized dimension.This artistic development grew from a tendency to abstraction which emerged in Roman art from the third century onward, becoming more pronounced in the fourth and fifth centuries. Official portraits, whether marble effigies or ivory diptychs, were produced with an ever-increasing concern for stylization; this is perceptible here in the treatment of the eyes and hair. Deliberately stylized features and a taste for ornamental detail took precedence over classical sculptural preoccupations with volume and contours, signifying a complete break with the naturalistic tradition.This disaffection for three-dimensional sculpture is characteristic of the age; it marks the end of classical art, and the beginning of medieval forms of representation. The tendency developed in Byzantine art, which similarly sought to represent a sublimated image of the role of emperor, based on stylized features and, in particular, an exaggerated emphasis on the eyes.

This likeness of Tiberius corresponds to the ""imperium maius"" style of portrait that was created in AD 13, when Augustus granted Tiberius powers equal to his own. This head (which may have belonged to a statue wearing a cuirass) differs from other portraits of the same group in its austerity, which may have been due to this (very hypothetical) military character, but more probably resulted from the provincial origin of the work.
Tiberius
This stern countenance is the familiar one of Tiberius, prior to his accession to the head of the Roman Empire. The thin, rather bony face is structured by a well-defined chin and cheekbones. The rather forbidding expression is reinforced by the narrow, tight-lipped mouth. The short hair, which is hardly detailed, is styled in a fringe with very characteristic forked locks over the high forehead.
Augustus' successor
Tiberius (born in 42 BC) became the stepson of Augustus when the emperor married his mother Livia. He won renown for his glorious military career, but it was not until Augustus' appointed successors had died that the aging emperor resigned himself to adopting his stepson and making him his heir in 4 BC.In AD 13, shortly before Augustus' death, Tiberius was named ""imperium maius,"" a title that made him the emperor's equal by granting him supreme power in religious, legal, military, and civil affairs. A group of portraits has been linked to this event, as it shows similarities to an effigy on a coin that was minted for the occasion. The head in the Louvre belongs to this group, known as the ""imperium maius type.""
Augustan classicism
The style of this likeness is typical of portraits from the Augustan period: the influence of Republican portraiture is still present, but tempered by idealization with a strongly classicizing tendency. The sculptor's rendering of individual features - wide forehead and bony face - created an obvious resemblance to the future emperor, but this was toned down by the regularity of the face and its rather cold expression.The head from Philomelium differs from the other portraits of its group, however, in the ruggedness with which the princely features are rendered. This may have been because the statue was a military one and portrayed Tiberius wearing a cuirass. There is no material evidence, however, to support this theory. Perhaps the provincial origin of the head (perceptible in the summary treatment of the hair) suffices to explain the portrait's rather rugged appearance.
